### A.2.6:13 - Playbooks (Informative)

#### A.2.6:13.1 - Manager’s 6‑step adoption checklist

1. **Name the TargetSlice.** Write the tuple (Context, versions, environment params, `Γ_time`).
2. **Check scope coverage.** “Claim/Work scope covers TargetSlice?” If **no**, either **ΔG+** (publish wider scope with support) or **decline**.
3. **Check rigor if gated.** If ESG requires it, ensure `U.Formality ≥ F_k`.
4. **Check evidence freshness (R).** Validate windows/decay policies; do not conflate with coverage.
5. **Bridge if Cross‑context.** Require declared Bridge, CL, and loss notes; accept **R** penalties.
6. **Record the decision.** Keep the slice and guard outcomes with the StateAssertion (auditability).

#### A.2.6:13.2 - Architect’s design rubric for scopes

* **Prefer predicates over prose.** Name parameters, ranges, Standards by **version**, and `Γ_time`.
* **Factor common conditions.** Use Refit to normalize units and factor shared predicates; do not widen by stealth.
* **Partition support lines.** If you plan a **SpanUnion**, document independence up front.
* **Keep scope thin & honest.** Publish what you can support; add slices as support appears (ΔG+).
* **Design Bridges early.** When interop is planned, sketch mapping characteristics and **expected CL**; plan **R** penalties.

#### A.2.6:13.3 - Review anti‑patterns & fixes

| Anti‑pattern                                    | Why it’s wrong                   | Fix                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Latest” time by default                        | Non‑deterministic; violates §8.2 | Declare `Γ_time` explicitly (point/window/policy)          |
| Using “domain” in guards                        | Not addressable; hides slices    | Replace with concrete `U.ContextSlice` tuples              |
| Treating “more abstract wording” as wider scope | Abstraction ≠ applicability      | Keep **AT/D** separate; widen **G** only with explicit ΔG+ |
| Publishing union without independence           | Overstates coverage              | Justify independence or publish serial intersection only   |
| Cross‑context use without Bridge                   | Silent semantic drift            | Require Bridge + CL; apply **R** penalties                 |

#### A.2.6:13.4 - Minimal DSL snippet for scope blocks (illustrative)

```
claimScope:
  Context: MaterialsLab@2026
  Standards:
    - rig: Calib-v3
    - api: v2.3
  env:
    substrate: Al6061
    temp: [120, 150] # °C
    dwell: { max: "2h" }
  gamma_time: { window_days: 365 }
```

*(Illustrative only; the specification does not mandate a particular syntax.)*

#### A.2.6:13.5 - Profiles as Scope configurations (informative)
**Idea.** A **Scope profile** is a **named, editioned configuration** that expands to a concrete `U.Scope` predicate block (over `U.ContextSlice`), used to avoid repetition and to keep declarations consistent across carriers.

**Rules.**
* **P1 (Expansion).** Profiles are macros: guards **MUST** expand them to explicit predicates before evaluating `Scope covers TargetSlice`.
* **P2 (Edition).** Profiles are editioned; changing a profile’s predicates is a content change for any carrier that references it.
* **P3 (No stealth widen).** A profile update MUST NOT implicitly widen a carrier’s published scope; ΔG+ must be explicit in that carrier.
* **P4 (Bridge awareness).** If a profile implies Cross‑context use, it MUST name the Bridge and CL policy; CL penalties apply to **R** only.
* **P5 (Locality).** Profiles are context‑local conveniences; they do not introduce new scope types.

**Examples (illustrative).**
— An engineering context defines `Ops‑Lab‑v3` as a profile pinning Standards, environment selectors, and a rolling `Γ_time` policy; claims, capabilities, and publications may reference it as a shorthand.
— A publication stack defines `TechCard‑Lite@Σ` as a profile that **narrows** `U.PublicationScope` to slices where required pins are available.
