### A.2.6:14 - Governance Hooks & Audits

#### A.2.6:14.1 - Governance metadata (normative)

Contexts that adopt USM SHALL record, per scope‑aware decision:

* **Owner.** Episteme (for Claim scope) or Capability (for Work scope).
* **TargetSlice tuple.** Context, vocab/roles, versioned Standards, environment selectors, **`Γ_time`**.
* **Guard outcomes.** Membership result, Bound measures (for Work scope), Freshness predicates (R).
* **Bridge info (if any).** Mapping summary, **CL**, loss notes, applied R penalty.
* **ΔG log.** Widen/narrow/refit; edition policy outcome.

#### A.2.6:14.2 - USM compliance levels (informative)

* **USM‑Ready.** Context declares adoption; editors trained; lexicon updated.
* **USM‑Guarded.** All ESG/Method–Work guards use Claim/Work scope and `Γ_time`.
* **USM‑Auditable.** Decision records include TargetSlice tuples and Bridge/CL details.
* **USM‑Composed.** Serial intersection and SpanUnion are implemented in composition tooling.

#### A.2.6:14.3 - Audit checklist (informative)

* Does each guard **name** a concrete **TargetSlice**?
* Is **membership** deterministically recomputable from published predicates?
* Are **freshness** and **coverage** separate predicates?
* For Cross‑context use: is there a **Bridge** with **CL** and loss notes?
* For parallel support: is **independence** justified?

#### A.2.6:14.4 - Risk controls (informative)

* **Silent widening.** Require ΔG+ review; flag any scope increase without new support/Bridge.
* **Opaque slices.** Disallow “domain” placeholders; enforce addressable selectors.
* **Time drift.** Require `Γ_time` policies (rolling windows) for time‑sensitive scopes.
