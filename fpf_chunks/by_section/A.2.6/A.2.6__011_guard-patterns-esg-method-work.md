### A.2.6:10 - Guard Patterns (ESG & Method–Work)

#### A.2.6:10.1 - Common guard shape

A scope‑aware guard has the form:

```
Guard := ScopeCoverage AND TimePolicy AND (EvidenceFreshness?) AND (BridgePolicy?)
```

**Admissibility note (normative; A.6.1 alignment).** If `ScopeCoverage` is **unknown** (due to unknown slice keys, unmappable translation, missing `Γ_time`, etc.), the guard MUST NOT silently treat this as `false`. It MUST either abstain (fail closed) or apply an explicit R‑lane degradation policy.

Where:

* **ScopeCoverage**: `Scope covers TargetSlice` (singleton or finite set), see §7.1.
* **TimePolicy**: explicit `Γ_time` selector(s); implicit “latest” is forbidden (§8.2).
* **EvidenceFreshness**: optional R‑lane freshness/decay predicates; **separate** from ScopeCoverage (§8.5).
* **BridgePolicy**: required if the Scope and TargetSlice are in **different Contexts**; declares Bridge, CL, loss notes (§7.4).

The guard **fails closed** (no membership ⇒ denial), and evaluation is **deterministic** given the slice tuple (§8.4).

#### A.2.6:10.2 - ESG guard families (epistemes)

**EG‑1 - ClaimScopeCoverage (mandatory).**
The state transition MUST include a predicate:

```
U.ClaimScope(episteme) covers TargetSlice
```

* **Singleton**: `TargetSlice ∈ ClaimScope`.
* **Finite set**: `TargetSet ⊆ ClaimScope`.

**EG‑2 - Formality threshold (if required by ESG).**
When rigor is gated, the guard MUST reference C.2.3:

```
U.Formality(episteme) ≥ F_k
```

**EG‑3 - Evidence freshness (R‑lane).**
If the state implies trust, a separate predicate MUST assert freshness windows for bound evidence:

```
Fresh(evidence, window)  AND  (NoExpiredBindings)
```

**EG‑4 - Cross‑context usage.**
If `TargetSlice.Context ≠ episteme.Context`, the guard MUST require a declared Bridge and CL:

```
Bridge(source=episteme.Context, target=TargetSlice.Context)  AND  CL ≥ c
```

> **Effect:** CL penalties apply to **R**, not to **F/G** (§7.4). The ESG guard MAY also **narrow** the mapped Claim scope when mapping losses are known.

**EG‑5 - ΔG triggers.**
If the transition publishes a **wider** Claim scope (ΔG+), the guard MUST capture the new support or the new Bridge and, if Context policy so dictates, mint a new edition (PhaseOf).

**EG‑6 - Independence for SpanUnion (when claiming parallel scope).**
When the episteme declares a **SpanUnion** across independent lines, the guard MUST include an **independence justification** (pointer to the support partition). No independence ⇒ no union.

*(Informative note.)* Managers often combine EG‑1 (coverage) + EG‑2 (F threshold) + EG‑3 (freshness) for “Effective” or “Approved” states, and EG‑4 when adopting claims across Contexts.

#### A.2.6:10.3 - Method–Work guard families (capabilities)

**WG‑1 - WorkScopeCoverage (mandatory).**
A capability can be used to deliver a Work step only if:

```
U.WorkScope(capability) covers JobSlice
```

**WG‑2 - `U.WorkMeasures` satisfied** (mandatory for deliverables).
Guards MUST bind quantitative measures that the capability promises in the JobSlice:

```
SLO/target measures satisfied (latency ≤ L, throughput ≥ T, tolerance ≤ ε, … )
```

**WG‑3 - `U.QualificationWindow` holds** (mandatory for operational use).
Operational guards MUST assert that qualification windows (qualification/inspection/recert intervals) hold **at `Γ_time`**:

```
ValidityWindow(capability) holds at Γ_time
```

**WG‑4 - Cross‑context use of capability.**
If the JobSlice is in another Context:

```
Bridge(source=capability.Context, target=JobSlice.Context)  AND  CL ≥ c
```

CL penalties affect **R** (confidence in deliverability), **not** Work scope; however, the guard SHOULD narrow the mapped Work scope to account for known mapping losses.

**WG‑5 - Δ(WorkScope).**
When widening Work scope (new operating ranges/platforms), the guard MUST require evidence at the new slices (measures + qualification windows). Refit (e.g., new units/parametrization) requires no new evidence.

#### A.2.6:10.4 - Bridge‑aware guard macro (reusable)

A reusable macro for Cross‑context guards:

```
Guard_XContext(Scope, TargetSlice) :=
    exists Bridge b: (b.source = owner(Scope).Context AND b.target = TargetSlice.Context)
AND CL(b) ≥ c
AND Scope’ = translate(b, Scope)
AND Scope’ covers TargetSlice
AND (Apply CL penalty to R)
```

* **Owner(Scope).** The carrier that declares the scope: an **Episteme** (for `U.ClaimScope`), a **Capability** (for `U.WorkScope`), or a **Publication carrier** (for `U.PublicationScope`).
* **Translate(b, Scope).** The partial mapping of a set of source slices to target slices induced by Bridge **b**. If a source slice is unmappable, it is dropped. The result is a set of target slices; **CL penalties apply to R only**.
* **Penalty to R**: applied per trust calculus; F and G remain as declared.

#### A.2.6:10.5 - Selector policy (Γ\_time)

All ESG and Method–Work guards MUST spell out **`Γ_time`**:

* **Point** (“as of 2026‑03‑31T00:00Z”).
* **Window** (“rolling 180 days”).
* **Policy** (“last lab calibration within 90 days”).

Implicit “latest” is not allowed. If multiple contributors declare different policies, **serial intersection** computes the overlap (§8.2).
