### A.2.6:15 - Cross‑Pattern Coordination

#### A.2.6:15.1 - With F–G–R (C.2.2)

* **G is Claim scope.** Use set algebra (∩ / SpanUnion).
* **F** remains the expression rigor (C.2.3); **R** captures evidence freshness and CL penalties.
* **Weakest‑link.** On dependency paths: **F\_composite = min(F)**, **R\_composite = min(R)**; **G** follows §7.2–§7.3 (set rules).

#### A.2.6:15.2 - With Formality (C.2.3)

* **No conflation.** Raising **F** does not change **G** unless scope predicates change.
* **Guarding rigor.** ESG may use `U.Formality ≥ F_k` alongside scope coverage.

#### A.2.6:15.3 - With Work & Run (A.15)

* **Work scope** aligns with the **execution context** of `U.Work`.
* Method–Work gates use **Work scope coverage** plus **measures** and **qualification windows**.

#### A.2.6:15.4 - With Bridges & CL (Part B)

* **CL only impacts R.** CL penalties reduce trust; they never rewrite **F** or **G**.
* **Best practice.** Narrow mapped scopes where mapping losses are material.

#### A.2.6:15.5 - With Capability governance (A.2.2)

* Capabilities MUST declare **Work scope**, **measures**, **qualification windows**; gates MUST verify all three.
* Capability refits that preserve the set (unit changes) are **Refit**, not Δ(WorkScope).
