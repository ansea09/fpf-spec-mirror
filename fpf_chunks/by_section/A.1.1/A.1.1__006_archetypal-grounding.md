### A.1.1:5 - Archetypal Grounding

The concept of a `U.BoundedContext` is universal and applies to both physical/operational domains and purely abstract/epistemic ones. Understanding these two archetypes clarifies its role as a fundamental FPF primitive.

| Archetype | Stewarding community | `U.BoundedContext` Example | Core Components Illustrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`U.System` Archetype** | A modern software engineering team | **`AgileProject:Phoenix`** | **`Glossary`**: Defines "Story Point," "Sprint," "Velocity." <br> **`Invariants`**: "Daily stand-up must not exceed 15 minutes." "A Story cannot move to 'Done' without a linked Test Case." <br> **`Roles`**: `ProductOwnerRole`, `ScrumMasterRole`, `DeveloperRole`. <br> **`Bridges`**: Maps `Velocity` metric to the `FinanceDept` context's `CostCenter:BudgetBurnRate`. |
| **`U.Episteme` Archetype** | A scientific community | **`Theory:SpecialRelativity`** | **`Glossary`**: Defines "Inertial Frame," "Lorentz Transformation," "Proper Time." <br> **`Invariants`**: "The speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers." "The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames." <br> **`Roles`**: `Postulate#AxiomaticCoreRole`, `Experiment#EvidenceRole`. <br> **`Bridges`**: Maps its concept of "Spacetime" to the `GeneralRelativity` context's more complex concept of "Curved Spacetime." |

**Key takeaway from grounding:**
This illustrates that a `U.BoundedContext` is not an abstract container but a **holon with concrete members and local rules**. For the engineering team, it's their project's "operating system." For the scientific theory, it's the "intellectual constitution." In both cases, the context defines what is true, what is possible, and what words mean *locally*.
