### A.1.1:9 - Consequences

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Enables True Modularity:** By encapsulating models, FPF can support large, complex systems where different teams can work on their own bounded contexts in parallel with minimal interference. | **Modeling Overhead:** Requires architects to explicitly think about and define the boundaries of their models, which can feel like extra work initially. *Mitigation:* This upfront effort is a strategic investment that prevents the much higher cost of integration chaos and semantic ambiguity later in the project. |
| **Resolves Ambiguity and Paradox:** Provides a formal mechanism to manage synonyms, homonyms, and conflicting models (like the Pluto example). It transforms "it depends" into a precise, queryable structure. | **Bridge Maintenance:** As contexts evolve, the bridges between them must be maintained. *Mitigation:* FPF tooling should support "link integrity" checks to automatically flag broken or outdated bridges. |
| **Makes Rules Explicit:** The `Invariants` component of a context makes the local rules and invariants for a project or theory explicit, documented, and auditable. | - |
| **Foundation for Scalable Autonomy:** In multi-agent systems, each agent can operate within its own bounded context, communicating with others through well-defined bridges. This is a prerequisite for building robust, decentralized systems. | - |
