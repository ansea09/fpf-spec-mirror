### C.31.ASAP:10 - Rationale

`C.31` and `C.31.RSA` can expose scale-sensitive characteristics and reusable-structure residue, but they should not themselves decide which architecture alternative is preferable under scale. C.31.ASAP governs this architecture scale-preference claim family; it is narrower than general BLP and broader than one measurement card.

The pattern adapts BLP-style scale-amenability to architecture: prefer the alternative that preserves or improves reusable structure over a declared scale window when safety, law-domain, and assurance boundaries are comparable. Treat modularity, reuse, platform practice, and mathematical coarse-graining as candidate cues. Base the preference on the named scale variable and window, expected stable or improving structure, exception-growth risk, and available slope or scale-probe evidence or no-probe reason.
