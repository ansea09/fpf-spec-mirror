### C.31.ASAP:10 - Rationale

C.31.ASAP is added because `C.31` and `C.31.RSA` can expose scale-sensitive characteristics and reusable-structure residue, but they should not themselves decide which architecture alternative is preferable under scale. C.31.ASAP governs this architecture scale-preference claim family; it is narrower than general BLP and broader than one measurement card.

The pattern adapts BLP-style scale-amenability to architecture: prefer the alternative that preserves or improves reusable structure over a declared scale window when safety, law-domain, and assurance boundaries are comparable. It also blocks the common shortcut that treats modularity, reuse, platform practice, or mathematical coarse-graining as scale-preference evidence by itself.
