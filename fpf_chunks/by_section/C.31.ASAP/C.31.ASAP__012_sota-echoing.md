### C.31.ASAP:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Source family | Source-use relation | C.31.ASAP contribution | Practitioner use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Software product-line and variability-management practice (`https://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/variability-in-software-product-lines/`; `https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.21353`) | Mature variability lineage plus current SPLE-review cues. | Adopt variability slots, product-line reuse, exception inventory, and refactor triggers as architecture scale-preference fields. | Before preferring the product-line alternative, name the scale window, variability slots, exception curve, and source-return condition. |
| Product-platform and modular product-architecture practice (`https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00163-023-00427-1`; `https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11089`) | Current engineering-design source line for modular product architecture, assembly orientation, product-family reuse, and manufacturing-aware modularity. | Adopt the product-family commonality and variety trade-off: declare variation points, interface rules, assembly or realization constraints, exception curve, and source-return condition. | State which product-family variation is scaled, which structure remains stable, and which bounded exception is allowed. |
| Platform-engineering maturity practice (`https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/fr/whitepapers/platform-eng-maturity-model/`) | Current platform-practice source for platform service set, extension-rule, substitution-policy, and maturity-pressure claims. | Adapt platform practice into extension-rule, substitution-policy, conformance-expectation, and exception-growth checks. | Treat platform maturity as a source cue; declare the architecture scale variable and exception behavior before scale-preference use. |
| C.19.1 BLP in FPF | FPF-local preference discipline for general scale-amenable methods. | Specialize the preference idea to architecture alternatives, selected structures, scale variables, and architecture slope vector. | Use C.19.1 for method-family policy and C.31.ASAP for architecture scale preference. |
| C.29 RG and coarse-graining lens use in FPF | FPF-local mathematical-lens discipline. | Require scale window, coarse-graining rule, preserved structure, lost structure, and source-return condition for RG-like architecture scale reasoning. | Use `MLU.Description@RGArchitecture` or `MLU.Description@MultilevelLearningFrustration` when the lens changes the next admissible use. |
