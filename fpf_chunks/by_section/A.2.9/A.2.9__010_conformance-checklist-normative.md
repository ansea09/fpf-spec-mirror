### A.2.9:7 — Conformance Checklist (normative)

1. **CC‑A.2.9‑1 (Accountable performer).** A normative `U.SpeechAct` record **MUST** identify `performedBy` as an accountable `RoleAssignmentRef` and **MUST NOT** use a specification episteme, interface-description episteme, or document-carried episteme as performer.
2. **CC‑A.2.9‑2 (ActTypes declared).** A `U.SpeechAct` record **MUST** include at least one `SpeechActTypeRef` recognized in its judgement context.
3. **CC‑A.2.9‑3 (Window explicit).** A `U.SpeechAct` record **MUST** have an explicit `window` (or inherit a window from its parent work record) so freshness and gating can be evaluated.
4. **CC‑A.2.9‑4 (Observable when used for gate checks or provenance).** If a speech act is cited by a checklist/guard or by `U.Commitment.source.speechActRef`, it **SHALL** have at least one `utteranceRef` or `carrierRef` that allows observation and audit in the given context; evidence-critical uses **SHOULD** cite at least one carrier via SCR/RSCR per A.10.
5. **CC‑A.2.9‑5 (Effects by reference).** If the act is intended to institute/update commitments/roles or statuses, those effects **SHOULD** be referenced in `institutes.*` by stable IDs.
6. **CC‑A.2.9‑6 (Bridge-only cross-context use).** If a `SpeechActRef` is interpreted for gate checks or provenance in a different bounded context than the act’s judgement context, the referencing object **MUST** cite the Bridge/policy that licenses that cross-context interpretation (no “same label implies same force”).
