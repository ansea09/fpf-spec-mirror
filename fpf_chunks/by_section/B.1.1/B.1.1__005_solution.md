### B.1.1:4 - Solution

#### B.1.1:4.1 - The shape: a typed, scoped, acyclic graph

**Definition.**

```
DependencyGraph D = (V, E, scope, notes)
```

* **V (nodes):** each `v ∈ V` is a `U.Holon` with:

  * `holonKind ∈ {U.System, U.Episteme}`
  * `DesignRunTag ∈ {design, run}` (A.4) — **single, uniform per D**
  * a declared `U.Boundary` (A.14)
  * optional characteristics (e.g., F–G–R, CL, Agency metrics) for use by downstream patterns (B.1.2/3; B.3; A.13)
* **E (edges):** each `e ∈ E` is a **mereological** relation from the **normative vocabulary `V_rel`** (below).
* **scope:** the uniform temporal scope of the entire graph (`design` or `run`).
* **acyclicity:** `D` **MUST** be a DAG. Any cycle requires refactoring or elevation to a Meta‑Holon (B.2).

> **Strict distinction (A.15).**
> `DependencyGraph` encodes **part–whole** only. Order goes to Γ\_ctx/Γ\_method. Time evolution goes to Γ\_time. Resource spending goes to Γ\_work. Cross‑boundary influence goes to `U.Interaction` (not parthood).

#### B.1.1:4.2 - Normative edge vocabulary `V_rel` (A.14 compliant)

Only the following **four** **mereological** relations are allowed in `E` (A.14):

| Family               | Relation             | Short intent                                            | Where it belongs                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Structural**       | **ComponentOf**      | physical/machined part in an assembly                   | Γ_sys                               |
|                      | **ConstituentOf**    | logical/content part in a conceptual whole              | Γ_epist                             |
| **Quantity & Phase** | **PortionOf**        | quantitative fraction of a homogeneous stock or carrier | Γ_sys / Γ_work                      |
|                      | **PhaseOf**          | temporal phase/slice of the *same carrier*              | Γ_time / Γ_work                     |

**Not in `V_rel` (by design):**
* `SerialStepOf`, `ParallelFactorOf` — **order/concurrency** edges of Γ_method/Γ_ctx; **not** parthood; keep them out of `E` (see § 4.1 A.15 and Part B.1.5).
* `MemberOf` — **non‑mereological** collective membership; model in Γ_collective (B.1.7), **not** in `E` (**see § 9**).
 * `RepresentationOf`, `MapsTo`, `Implements` — these are **mappings**, not parthood; model them at the value level (A.15) or as `U.Interaction` between holons.
* `RoleBearerOf` — links a `U.System` to a `U.Role`; **not** parthood (see A.12, A.15).
* Any “is‑a” (`subClassOf`) taxonomic relation — orthogonal to parthood.

#### B.1.1:4.3 - Minimal axioms & type guards per relation

| Relation             | Axioms (informal)                                                 | Guards / When to use                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **ComponentOf**      | anti‑symmetric; transitive; acyclic                               | Physical assemblies; interfaces compose via BIC (B.1.2). Do **not** use for collections or pipelines.              |
| **ConstituentOf**    | anti‑symmetric; transitive; acyclic                               | Conceptual or formal wholes (papers, proofs, specifications). Do **not** use for material parts.                   |
| **MemberOf** (**outside `V_rel`**) | not transitive; anti‑symmetric (w\.r.t. same collection); acyclic | Sets/teams/libraries; the whole is a *collective* holon. **Not admissible in `E`**; model via **Γ_collective (B.1.7)**. Use `PortionOf` for homogeneous stocks. |
| **PortionOf**        | anti‑symmetric; additive; acyclic                                 | Quantitative partitions of a *homogeneous* carrier (mass, volume, bytes). Requires an **extensive** attribute.     |
| **PhaseOf**          | anti‑symmetric; covers a timeline; acyclic                        | Time‑slices of the *same* carrier identity. Use only with explicit carrier and non‑overlapping intervals.          |

> **Carrier identity for `PhaseOf`.** The same carrier identity across phases must be explicit (e.g., *this* frame across heat/dwell/quench; *this* theory across revisions). If identity changes, you are modelling a **Transformer** creating a **new** holon (A.12) — not a phase.

#### B.1.1:4.4 - Selection guide (didactic, normative in spirit)

Use this **one‑page decision** to pick the edge correctly:

1. **Is it a part–whole relation at all?**
   If it is mapping, influence, or reference → **not** parthood. Use `U.Interaction` or value‑level links (A.15).

2. **Is it physical vs. conceptual composition?**
   Physical assembly → **ComponentOf**.
   Conceptual/content inclusion → **ConstituentOf**.

3. **Is it a collection?**
   If the “whole” is a collection/collective → **MemberOf** **(outside `E`, route to Γ_collective (B.1.7))**.
   *Note:* a team’s *members* are `MemberOf` (**outside `E`**); the team’s *tools* are likely `ComponentOf`.

4. **Is it order‑sensitive execution?**
   If step order changes semantics -> **apply A.15 (ordered relations)** and aggregate with **Γ_ctx / Γ_method**.
   Do **not** encode order as parthood in this section.

5. **Is it a quantitative fraction of a homogeneous stock?**
   If yes → **PortionOf** (requires an extensive attribute; use in Γ\_sys / Γ\_work).

6. **Is it the *same* carrier across time?**
   If yes → **PhaseOf** (then aggregate with Γ\_time / Γ\_work).

> **Common anti‑patterns and the fix**
> • Using **MemberOf** for material stocks → replace with **PortionOf**.
> • Drawing cross‑boundary “parts” → replace edge with **U.Interaction** plus `ComponentOf` *inside* each holon.
> • Using **ConstituentOf** for a module cage or bracket → that is **ComponentOf**.
> • Treating representation (file ↔ thing) as parthood → keep as value‑level mapping (A.15), not in `D`.

#### B.1.1:4.5 - **Γ_m (Compose‑CAL)** — structural aggregators & trace shape

**Purpose.** Provide a **minimal constructional generator** for **structural mereology** that keeps the kernel small (C-5), aligns with **A.14** (Portions/Phases/Components discipline), and feeds Working-Model layer publication in LOG without importing tooling or notations.

**Operators (aggregators).**

Γ_m.sum(parts : Set[U.Entity])       → W : U.Holon
  // for each p ∈ parts assert internal U.KernelPartOf(p, W)

Γ_m.set(elems : Multiset[U.Entity])  → C : U.Holon
  // for each e ∈ elems assert internal U.KernelPartOf(e, C)
  // outward **MemberOf** remains a non‑mereological signal per A.14 (does not build holarchies)

Γ_m.slice(ent : U.Entity, facet : U.Facet) → S : U.Holon
  // assert internal U.KernelPartOf(S, ent) and record facet label

**Trace (conceptual, notation‑independent).**
`Trace = ⟨ op ∈ {sum, set, slice}, inputs, output, notes ⟩`
Notes capture boundary tags (A.14), scope (`design|run`), and any independence declarations used by the Quintet proofs (below).

**Invariant footprint on Γ_m traces (inherits B.1 Quintet).**
* **IDEM** — singleton fold returns the part unchanged.
* **COMM/LOC** — results are invariant under re‑order and local factorisation given an independence declaration (IND‑LOC).
* **WLNK** — aggregate cannot exceed the weakest limiting attribute among parts; synergy escalates via **B.2 Meta‑Holon Transition**.
* **MONO** — improving a part on a monotone characteristic cannot worsen the whole, ceteris paribus.

**Exclusions and routing (A.15/A.14).**
No `parallel` or `temporalSlice` constructor is introduced here; **sequence/parallelism** live in `Γ_ctx/Γ_method`, and **temporal parts** in `Γ_time`. This preserves the firewall between structure, order and time mandated by A.15/A.14.

**Internal proof relation.**
`U.KernelPartOf` names the **constructional edges inside traces**; it is not part of the public `V_rel` and appears only in the trace/proof narrative (definitional didactic status).

#### B.1.1:4.6 - Scope and boundary rules (make graphs foldable)

1. **Single temporal scope:** all nodes in `D` share `design` **or** `run`. No mixing (“chimera” graphs are invalid).
2. **Declared boundary:** every holon in `D` has a `U.Boundary`; any cross‑holon influence must be an explicit `U.Interaction`, not parthood.
3. **Acyclicity:** if a cycle is detected, either (a) refactor (e.g., split a collective from an assembly), or (b) escalate to **Meta‑Holon Transition** (B.2) if a new “whole” with novel properties is intended.
4. **Order & time routing:** do **not** encode sequence or history with structural edges; route to Γ\_ctx, Γ\_method, and Γ\_time explicitly.
5. **Resource routing:** do **not** encode costs with structural edges; route to Γ\_work (B.1.6) across declared boundaries.

#### B.1.1:4.7 - What “Proofs” mean here (preview of Part 2)

Each Γ flavour (Γ\_sys, Γ\_epist, Γ\_method, Γ\_time, and Γ\_work) **must** attach a small, reusable **Proof Kit** showing the Quintet on the given `D`:

* **IDEM**: singleton fold = identity.
* **COMM/LOC**: independence conditions + invariance under local reorder/factorisation.
* **WLNK**: weakest‑link bound (e.g., critical input caps, weakest claim).
* **MONO**: explicit monotone characteristics (what “cannot get worse” means here).
