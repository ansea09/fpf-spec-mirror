### A.2.5:17 - Acceptance harness (static conformance)

Author‑facing checks; **notation‑free**, **concept‑level**. Use them when drafting or reviewing an RSG.

**SCR‑A.2.5‑S01 - Local scope.** Every state name is qualified by `(Role, Context)`. No global states.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S02 - Enactability mark.** The set **S\_en** is explicit; each ◉ state is listed.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S03 - Observable checklists.** Each state has a Checklist of **observable** predicates (Observation / Evaluation / SpeechAct / Work evidence).
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S04 - Green‑Gate wiring.** Every `MethodDescription` step that names the Role either (a) names its ◉ state(s) or (b) relies on the default “any ◉” policy; the RSG declares which.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S05 - Guard discipline.** Guards only **gate transitions**; they do not encode task order.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S06 - SoD by state.** Incompatibilities (⊥) are declared over **states** (or “any ◉”), not over bare role names.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S07 - Specialisation entailment.** For every `R' ≤ R`, a refinement map `π: S(R')→S(R)` is provided; each mapped pair has an entailment note (why `Checklist_R' ⇒ Checklist_R`).
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S08 - Human scale.** `|S| ≤ 7` unless a one‑line didactic rationale is recorded.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S09 - Status‑only roles.** If `S_en=∅`, the Role is explicitly tagged **status‑only**; it cannot open the Green‑Gate.
**SCR‑A.2.5‑S10 - Bridge discipline.** Any cross‑context reuse is via an Alignment Bridge (F.9) with recorded `CL` and losses; no silent imports.
