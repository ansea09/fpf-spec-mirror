### F.8:12 - Extended worked examples

#### F.8:12.1 - **Execution, observation, and acceptance** (engineers)

**Need.** A reusable label for “what actually happened and how it was checked against the promise”.
**senseFamilies.** Execution (stance: run); Measurement (KD); Status (accept/reject).

**Contexts.**
`IEC 61131‑3` (task run), `PROV‑O` (Activity), `SOSA/SSN` (Observation), `ITIL 4` (SLO/SLA).

**Reasoning.**

* `Execution`: `IEC` SenseCell (task run) and `PROV` SenseCell (Activity). There exists a **row** *execution-occurrence* at **Assignment-eligibility** with CL = 2 → **reuse row** at **Assignment-eligible** scope; do not infer Type-structure.
* `Measurement`: `SOSA` Observation cell; no Cross‑context needed → **reuse cell**.
* `Status`: `ITIL` SLO/SLA cell; **Role Description** “SLO‑Target” anchored to ITIL cell.

**Outcome.** Prose may say: “This **execution-occurrence** (row\@assignment/enactment-eligibility) was **observed** (SOSA cell) and **evaluated against the SLO** (ITIL cell).” No new U.Type; no hidden merges.

#### F.8:12.2 - **Actor across workflow and provenance** (managers)

**Need.** A single everyday label for “the responsible party” in diagrams.
**senseFamily.** Role (behavioural mask in prose/diagrams).

**Contexts.** `BPMN 2.0` (Participant), `PROV‑O` (Agent).

**Reasoning.** A **Naming‑only** row “actor” exists, CL = 2. **Reuse the row** at Naming‑only.
If assignable behaviour is needed in a model, **mint Role Description** anchored to **BPMN Participant** (not to the row).

**Outcome.** Diagrams show “actor”; formal sections reference `Participant` or `Agent` as appropriate.

#### F.8:12.3 - **Accuracy across metrology and data quality** (researchers)

**Need.** Treat “accuracy” consistently across ISO 80000 (metrology) and ISO/IEC 25024 (data quality).
**senseFamily.** Measurement.

**Contexts.** `ISO 80000‑1` (quantity/units), `ISO/IEC 25024` (data quality).

**Reasoning.** Bridges indicate **related but not identical** definitions; procedures differ. Existing **KD‑metric** row “accuracy” has CL = 2 with **loss note**: *population vs instrument focus*. **Reuse row** at KD‑metric scope for dashboards; **do not** use the row to justify interchange of procedures.

**Outcome.** One label in reports; method sections still cite the context‑local procedure.

#### F.8:12.4 **Subtype relation across OWL and a curated taxonomy** (formalists)

**Need.** Present “is‑a” uniformly across OWL 2 classes and a domain taxonomy.
**senseFamily.** Type‑structure.

**Contexts.** `OWL 2` (SubClassOf), `Taxonomy_X` (curated “is‑a” edges).

**Reasoning.** F.7 row “subtype‑order” exists at **Type‑structure scope** with CL = 3 (only after verifying acyclicity & anti‑symmetry in `Taxonomy_X`). If the curated taxonomy contains cycles, **downgrade** to Naming‑only or reject the row.

**Outcome.** When CL≥3, you may **reuse row** for structural proofs; else teach differences.
