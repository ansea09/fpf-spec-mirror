### B.1.3:2 - Problem

Naive aggregation of knowledge holons causes recurring failures:

1. **Trust inflation by averaging.** Averaging confidences of conflicting claims creates a falsely “reliable” whole; violates **WLNK** and **B.3** conservatism.
2. **Provenance erasure.** Merges that drop sources, methods, or links break **A.10 Evidence Graph Referring** and make results unauditable.
3. **Semantic drift.** Folding across mismatched concepts without explicit **mappings** (and their **CL**) yields incoherent composites that look formal but mean nothing.
4. **Order blindness.** Arguments with essential **dependency order** (premise ⇒ lemma ⇒ conclusion) are treated as sets; non‑commutativity is lost and results become non‑reproducible.
5. **Semantic-context chimeras.** Combining claims whose local senses or reference schemes differ, without exact mappings and—when meanings cross—an F.9 Bridge plus a separately warranted bounded-use claim, silently corrupts claims and inflates **R**.
6. **Category errors.** Importing **Γ\_sys** rules (e.g., “sum truth,” “avg formality”) into knowledge composition produces physically sounding but epistemically nonsensical models.
