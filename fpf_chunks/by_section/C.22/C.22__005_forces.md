### C.22:4 - Forces

| Force                        | Tension                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parsimony vs sufficiency** | Fewer fields to avoid ceremony **vs** enough to drive admissible gating.                                                              |
| **Unknowns**                 | Many traits are **unknown** in the initial problem record → tri‑state semantics must propagate to Acceptance without silent coercions.                |
| **CHR admissibility**             | **No mean on ordinals; no unit mixing**; polarity & scale type must be declared *before* aggregation.                             |
| **Locality vs portability**  | Problem is **in‑room**; still must cross **via Bridges**, with **CL** and (if planes differ) **CL^plane** penalties → **R** only. |
