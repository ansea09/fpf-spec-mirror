### Deprecations (normative)

The following terms **MUST NOT** name scope objects in normative text, guards, or conformance blocks:

* *applicability*, *envelope*, *generality*, *capability envelope*, *validity* (as a characteristic name).

Use instead:

* **`U.ClaimScope`** (*Claim scope*, nick **G**) for epistemes;
* **`U.WorkScope`** (*Work scope*) for capabilities;
* **`U.Scope`** only when explaining the abstract mechanism (not in guards).
