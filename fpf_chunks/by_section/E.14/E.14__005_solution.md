### E.14:4 - Solution

#### E.14:4.1 - Human-Centric principles
##### E.14:4.1.1 - Recognition text and assurance text
Human-facing patterns also need governed-object stability across recognition text and assurance text. The working reader should not meet one object in the recognition text and a different ontological kind in the assurance text. If the pattern distinguishes a governed object, the interpretive or operational move applied to that object, and the wider review or work process around it, those distinctions should be made explicit rather than hidden behind stylistic noun-swapping.

Working-Model-first drafting therefore also means subject-domain-first drafting. If a pattern is meant to help with a real review, design, cultural, research, or operational problem, the recognition text should open from that problem-owning moment before internal taxonomy or package architecture. If a broader umbrella head and a narrower operative branch are both live, the pattern should state that stack plainly enough that a cold reader can tell what the umbrella names, what branch is current, what object is governed, what move is being carried, and what wider work remains outside.

Under `F.18` local-first naming, the canonical pair here is **recognition text** and **assurance text**.
The earlier provisional `...shell` wording is retired.
These names refer to two reading-order surfaces inside one pattern, not to new publication-surface kinds or owner kinds.

For human-facing canonical patterns, Working-Model-first discipline should appear in a two-surface reading order.
The **recognition text** is the working text that a cold practitioner, manager, or researcher should be able to understand first: what situation this pattern is for, what it buys, what it is not for, and what ordinary mistake it helps prevent.
The **assurance text** is the heavier text that carries declaration, object discipline, modeling lens, law, reroute conditions, and other review work.

The assurance text may justify, tighten, or audit the working text, but it must not silently replace or strengthen the recognition-text claim.
Where semio-heavy or transform-heavy patterns need a compact ontological account, the assurance text should make three things explicit:
- the ontic target or governed object;
- the modeling substrate or mathematical lens when one is load-bearing;
- the publication or working surface by which the claim is presented.

This is a reading-order rule rather than a demand that every reader read the assurance text first.
The point is to keep the human-facing Working-Model surface primary while preserving a recoverable, auditable second surface beneath it.
> **E.14‑P.1 – Working‑Model first, stance explicit.**  **
> Operate one **Working‑Model** for all human‑facing discussion. For **each** assertion, the author **SHALL declare** a justification stance (`validationMode`) and choose the **appropriate assurance shoulder(s)**: **Mapping** (term↔kind alignment via **Lang‑CHR** / D‑Projection), **Logical** (CT2R alias semantics, scope/constraints), **Constructive** (Γₘ generative trace), and **Empirical Validation** (evidence via `U.EvidenceRole` in a declared `U.BoundedContext`).

> **E.14‑P.2 – Downward‑only dependency.**
> Information **may** flow from the Working‑Model down into any Assurance layer; **no Assurance layer may impose vocabulary or shape back upward** into the Working‑Model.
>
> **E.14‑P.3 – Small surface, big proof.**
> The Working‑Model exposes a **minimal set** of names (L‑1/L‑2 registers) and **a compact family of relations** used in everyday reasoning; precision and completeness are **proved below**.

> **E.14‑P.4 – Human registers first.**
> Terms in the Working‑Model are deliberately curated for **human legibility** (register‑badged, synonym‑aware). Synonym capture and language variance belong to Mapping; **only the chosen canonical label appears on the Working‑Model surface**.

> **E.14‑P.5 – Justification modes are explicit.**
> Each Working‑Model relation **declares** `validationMode ∈ {axiomatic, inferential, postulate}`.
> _axiomatic_ → **Constructive** grounding (Γₘ trace via `tv:groundedBy`); _inferential_ → **Logical** grounding (reasoned chain, often KD‑CAL‑backed for epistemic ties); _postulate_ → **Empirical Validation** (evidence bundle with scope and timespan). Empirical Validation (**LA**) may also accompany _inferential_ or _axiomatic_ claims as real‑world confirmation. **Mapping** contributes **TA**, **Logical/Constructive** contribute **VA**, and **Empirical** contributes **LA** (per the Trust & Assurance calculus; no calculus variables appear on the Working‑Model surface).

> **E.14‑P.6 – Parsimony at the surface.**
> No new Working‑Model relation types are introduced if the existing Logical aliases plus Constructive grounding suffice to capture the intended meaning.

> **E.14‑P.7 – Evidence is a first‑class support.**
> When *postulate* is chosen, authors **SHALL** attach an **evidence pointer** (Empirical Validation) appropriate to the claim and context, governed by `U.EvidenceRole` within a declared `U.BoundedContext`.

> **E.14‑P.8 – Working-model-first is not explanation-thin.**
> Human-facing parsimony does **not** license under-explained pattern prose. When a pattern claims a Working‑Model benefit, it **SHALL** still provide enough problem framing, rationale, and worked slices that readers can tell what the model clarifies, what remains on the assurance shoulders, and when a heavier review path is required.
