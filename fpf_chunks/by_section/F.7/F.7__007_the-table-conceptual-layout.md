### F.7:6 - The table (conceptual layout)

> One page. Fixed column order by Context. Each row fits in **five lines** max.

```
FPF Label (Tech / Plain) | Row Scope | Row CL(min) | [Context A] local label | [Context B] local label | [Context C] local label | Rationale | Counter‑examples
```

**Reading rules (didactic):**

1. **Cells are local.** A cell is **not** a translation; it is the Context’s **own** label for its SenseCell.
2. **Scope is king.** The FPF label only licenses sameness **within its Row Scope**. Outside that scope, treat cells as **different**.
3. **Row CL(min) governs trust.** Lower CL ⇒ narrower applicability; **never** up‑scope a row without revisiting Bridges.
4. **Rationale & counter‑examples** are **obligatory one‑liners**; if you need paragraphs, you need an F.9 walkthrough, not a row.

**Didactic name rationale** “Giants' table’” that alludes to *standing on the shoulders of giants*: each row explicitly leans on authoritative context of meaning (**U.BoundedContext**) established by prior disciplines and not imagined. It does **not** mean a physically large table; the name signals epistemic humility and traceable reliance on those sources. "We are like dwarfs on the shoulders of giants, so that we can see more than they, and things at a greater distance, not by virtue of any sharpness of sight on our part, or any physical distinction, but because we are carried high and raised up by their giant size." by Bernard of Chartres , d. c.1130, French philosopher.
