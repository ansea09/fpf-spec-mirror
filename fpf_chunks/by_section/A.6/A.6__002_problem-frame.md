### A.6:1 - Problem frame

Boundaries are where architecture lives: at the edge of a theory, an API, a protocol, a hardware connector, an organisational interface, or a published model. FPF already has the core building blocks to describe such edges:

* `U.Signature` as a *public, law‑governed declaration* (with Vocabulary, Laws, Applicability).
* `U.Mechanism` as a specialization that introduces operational “entry gates” (AdmissibilityConditions) and additional operational blocks (Transport, Audit, etc.).
* Multi‑view publication discipline via `U.MultiViewDescribing` (views + viewpoints).
* Strict separation of **EntityOfConcern vs Description episteme vs publication carrier** so we do not accidentally attribute agency or work to an episteme, or treat a file as the entity, claim, work, evidence, or decision.

Yet boundary descriptions in practice fail in a predictable way: authors blend several fundamentally different kinds of claims into one undifferentiated contract paragraph. The result is brittle architecture: signatures become entangled with runtime gates, deontic language is mixed into mathematical invariants, and “effects” are asserted without any disciplined carrier and evidence story.

This cluster overview makes one disciplined move:

1. Treat a boundary as a **stack of boundary layers** (Signature → Mechanism → work and evidence carriers) plus publication views and faces, and
2. Provide a **boundary discipline matrix** (2×2) that classifies statements by boundary layer, so evolution remains controlled and substitutions are possible.

*Terminology note (informative):* In this pattern:
* **Layer** names a stratum in the boundary stack (Signature → Mechanism → work and evidence carriers → Publication).
* **View** (`U.View`) is a Description-episteme projection under a viewpoint, not a publication file or document.
* **Viewpoint** (`U.Viewpoint`) is an accountability specification that constrains views.
* **Face** (MVPK sense) is a named publication view kind (`PlainView`, `TechCard`, `InteropCard`, `AssuranceLane`) whose rendering lives on a publication face or publication form on a carrier. Do not coin “signature or mechanism ...Surface” terms; use publication face, form, unit, carrier, and rendering terms only when publication use is live.
