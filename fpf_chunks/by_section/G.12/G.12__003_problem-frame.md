### G.12:2 — Problem frame

Dashboards routinely drift or become illegal when they:

* mix scales (ordinal treated as interval; “average maturity level”),
* hide normalization and re‑parameterization (“normalized score” with no CN‑Spec pins),
* silently cross Contexts or planes (implicit reuse without explicit Bridge/Plane routing),
* fail to pin editions of computation methods, descriptor spaces, or distances,
* turn selected sets or archives into a single scalar “winner” by dashboard fiat,
* cannot refresh selectively (no actionable telemetry pins; only narrative “this changed”).

We need a **dashboard kit** that makes the *method of obtaining dashboard values* explicit and auditable, while keeping universal invariants governed in **G.Core**.
