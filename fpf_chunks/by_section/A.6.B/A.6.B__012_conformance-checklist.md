### A.6.B:10 — Conformance Checklist

| ID                                       | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Purpose                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑A.6.B.1 (Atomicity).**              | A conforming boundary text **SHALL** decompose mixed sentences into **atomic claims** such that each atomic claim belongs to exactly one quadrant **L/A/D/E**.                                                    | Makes L/A/D/E classification unambiguous; prevents contract soup.       |
| **CC‑A.6.B.2 (Quadrant classification).** | Each atomic claim **MUST** be classified by its own modality and adjudication position, not by its owner-pattern family. When permission wording is present, the single branch in §8.4.1 **MUST** select the claim's job before assigning L/A/D/E. | Prevents one owner catalogue from replacing the square's decision. |
| **CC‑A.6.B.3 (Form and obtaining constraints).** | `L-*` and `A-*` claims **MUST NOT** use RFC deontic keywords as operators; a duty or commitment `D-*` claim **MUST** name its accountable subject, while a grant `D-*` claim **MUST** satisfy the participant and ground test in §8.4.1; neither claim text makes its object obtain. An `E-*` claim **MUST** name the work, evaluation, or observation that settles it and any evidence used for reliance. | Keeps claim text, institutional obtaining, and evaluated results distinct. |
| **CC‑A.6.B.4 (Explicit references).**    | Where a claim depends on another L/A/D/E-classified claim, that dependency **MUST** be expressed by explicit ID reference rather than restating the other claim in new words.                                                | Prevents paraphrase drift across layers and faces.           |
| **CC‑A.6.B.5 (E‑claim adjudicability).** | Each `E-*` claim names its exact predicate and object plus the actual work, evaluation, or observation, scope/window, comparison frame, and other conditions required to settle that predicate. It adds an evidence/source-use relation, carrier/schema, viewpoint, and consumer only when the receiving reliance decision depends on that support. | Makes work-effects adjudicable without forcing unrelated carrier apparatus into every result claim. |
| **CC‑A.6.B.6 (No gate smuggling).**      | Operational admissibility predicates **MUST NOT** appear as `L-*` laws in the signature layer; they **MUST** be `A-*` claims in the mechanism layer.                                                             | Preserves substitution and signature stability.          |
| **CC‑A.6.B.7 (No upward dependencies).** | `L-*` claims **MUST NOT** reference `A-*`, `D-*`, or `E-*`; `A-*` and `E-*` claims **MUST NOT** reference `D-*`.                                                                                                   | Preserves layering and prevents hidden coupling.         |
