### A.6.B:0 — Conventions

**Keywords.** The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **MAY**, and **SHALL** are to be interpreted as in RFC 2119/8174. Lower-case `must`, `may`, and `should` in explanatory prose is descriptive, not normative.

**Quadrant labels.** This pattern uses the classification labels **L / A / D / E** as *statement quadrants*:

* **L** — Laws & Definitions
* **A** — Admissibility & Gates
* **D** — Deontics & Commitments
* **E** — Work‑Effects & Evidence

These labels are **claim-classification labels for statements**, not MVPK face kinds and not pattern identifiers.

**Statement identifiers (recommended).** Classifiable statements **SHOULD** be given stable IDs with a quadrant prefix: `L-*`, `A-*`, `D-*`, `E-*`. Other sections and views **SHOULD** reference these IDs rather than restating the same constraint in new words.

**Non-collision note (informative).** The `A-*` prefix here is “Admissibility”, not Part-A numbering and not MVPK’s `AssuranceLane` face kind. If this is a readability hazard in your program, prefer an explicit `G-*` (“Gate”) local convention while keeping the quadrant name “Admissibility”. Also avoid introducing single-letter mnemonics for MVPK face kinds inside this cluster; spell face kinds in full to reduce collisions.

**Atomic claim.** An **atomic claim** is a sentence (or bullet) that performs exactly one logical role and is classifiable under exactly one quadrant. If a sentence mixes roles, it is **not atomic** and **MUST** be split before it can be classified.

**Adjudication substrate (for classification).** For the purposes of this square, an atomic claim is classified by where its own truth condition or governance content is settled. This tells you how to classify the sentence; it does not make a commitment, grant, or finding exist.

* **In-description or in-theory**: an `L-*` truth condition is settled by inspecting, proving, or type-validating the description; for a `D-*` claim, the description fixes the normative content and names the duty, commitment, or grant that the claim concerns.
* **In-work or in-execution**: deciding satisfaction requires observing executed work, inspecting carriers produced in work, or both.

**Note (important).** Writing a `D-*` claim records what the boundary says; it does not make the named duty, commitment, or grant exist or establish compliance. When the wording is about permission, use the permission-word branch in §8.4.1 to recover the exact object, what makes it obtain, and the evidence needed before reliance.

**Modality family.** A claim is either:

* **Truth‑conditional**: definitions, invariants, typing rules (“is”, “iff”, “∀”).
* **Governance**: governance conditions, obligations, commitments, and exclusions (the RFC keywords `MUST`, `SHOULD`, and `MAY`, “is admissible”, “is blocked”, “commits to”).
