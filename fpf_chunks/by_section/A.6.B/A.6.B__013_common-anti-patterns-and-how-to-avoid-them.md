### A.6.B:11 - Common Anti‑Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti‑pattern                 | Symptom                                            | Why it fails                                                | Repair (square‑consistent)                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gate‑as‑law**              | Preconditions written as “laws”                    | Collapses signature/mechanism boundary; breaks substitution | Move to `A-*` in Mechanism.AdmissibilityConditions; reference `L-*` terms.                  |
| **Deontics in predicates**   | “MUST” inside definitions or gates                 | Confuses governance with truth/admissibility                | Rewrite as `L-*`/`A-*` predicate; add `D-*` duty referencing it.                            |
| **Interface‑as‑promiser**    | “The API promises/guarantees …”                    | Category error (F.18): epistemes don’t promise              | Identify committing role (`D-*`), measured property (`E-*`), and metric definition (`L-*`). |
| **Evidence‑free guarantees** | “Guaranteed p95 latency” with no measurement story | Unadjudicable; turns into marketing                         | Create `E-*` with carriers + conditions; link commitment as `D-* → E-*`.                    |
| **Paraphrase drift**         | Same rule restated across faces                    | Divergence becomes invisible                                | Use IDs; faces cite IDs; optional Claim Register.                                           |
| **View‑fork semantics**      | A face introduces new L/A/D/E content              | Violates “no new semantics” publication discipline          | Move new claim into canonical layer (L/A/D/E) or mark as informative only.                  |
