### A.6.B:8 - Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

> **Informative.** Examples for learning the square; they do not add requirements beyond A.6.B:10.

#### A.6.B:8.1 - Tell (universal rule)

A boundary remains evolvable and auditable when every normative statement is decomposed into atomic claims, each claim is classified under exactly one quadrant of the Boundary Norm Square, and cross‑quadrant dependencies are expressed by explicit claim‑ID references rather than paraphrase.

#### A.6.B:8.2 - Show #1: Effect signature vs handler (post‑2015 effect systems)

A service boundary naturally mirrors **algebraic effects & handlers** practice (popularized broadly in the post‑2015 era, with mainstream effect handlers becoming especially prominent around OCaml 5):

* **L:** defines the operation vocabulary and laws (effect signature semantics).
* **A:** defines when the operation is admissible (runtime guard predicates).
* **D:** states who must enforce guards and what the provider commits to (operator and implementer duties; SLAs).
* **E:** ties “what happened” to observable carriers (traces, logs, metrics, and events) so commitments can be adjudicated.

The square prevents accidentally writing handler obligations as laws or treating observability as a definition.

#### A.6.B:8.3 - Show #2: ML evaluation protocol boundary (reproducibility discipline)

A published “evaluation protocol” boundary (common in modern ML governance) benefits from strict classification:

* **L:** metric definitions and invariants (e.g., what counts as AUROC; data partition invariants).
* **A:** admissibility gates (dataset usage-term constraints; pinned environment constraints; seed policy).
* **D:** checker and author duties (publish required faces; use declared dataset version; retention duties for run evidence carriers).
* **E:** evidence carriers (run logs, hashes, reports, trace IDs) and adjudication conditions (which viewpoint measures, what windows).

The square keeps “must use dataset vX” (D) separate from “evaluation is admissible iff dataset usage terms match” (A), and both separate from “a run produced report carrier R with hash h” (E).

#### A.6.B:8.4 — Worked Rewrite Kit (informative, recommended)

> **Informative.** This kit is a worked, copy‑pasteable restatement of A.6.B’s rules (atomicity, L/A/D/E classification, explicit references, triangle decomposition, and no‑upward dependencies). If anything here conflicts with A.6.B, **A.6.B is authoritative**.

##### A.6.B:8.4.0 - Goal

Convert a boundary-ish sentence that mixes “laws / gates / duties / evidence” into:

1. **atomic L/A/D/E-classified claims** (L/A/D/E),
2. **explicit references by claim ID** (no paraphrase duplication),
3. **a readable recomposition** (Tech + Plain),
4. **a minimal anti-pattern lint** (things we reject / flag).

##### A.6.B:8.4.1 - Micro-procedure (Atomize → Classify → Triangle → Link → Bind References → Recompose)

**Step 1 — Atomize.** Split mixed prose into atomic claims; each must classify to exactly one quadrant.

**Step 2 — Classify (L/A/D/E).**

* **L** if the claim is **truth‑conditional** and adjudicable *in‑description* (inspection, proof or type validation, or model reasoning **over declared assumptions**): definitions, invariants, typing and well-formedness constraints.
  **Guardrails:** `L-*` MUST NOT (i) use RFC deontic keywords as operators, (ii) encode runtime entry predicates (those are `A-*`), or (iii) assert evidence existence or measurement outcomes (those are `E-*`).
* **A** if it is an *in‑work* **gate predicate**: what the mechanism admits at application time (“admissible iff …”). It is not a duty and MUST NOT be phrased as one.
  **Guardrails:** `A-*` SHOULD be written in predicate form and MUST NOT (i) use RFC deontic keywords as if it were an agent obligation, (ii) claim that evidence carriers exist (that is `E-*`), or (iii) assign responsibility or enforcement (that is `D-*`).
  *(Do not confuse this with `Signature.Applicability`: applicability scopes intended meaning and intended use; it is not a runtime entry gate.)*
* **D** if it assigns **duties or commitments** to an accountable role assignment, `U.Role`, or admitted acting system (RFC keywords belong here; “the interface or system promises” does not).
  **Guardrails:** `D-*` MUST name an accountable subject and SHOULD reference `L-*`/`A-*`/`E-*` by ID rather than restating them in new words (to prevent paraphrase drift).
* **E** if it is an *in‑work* truth‑conditional claim about adjudicable effects and evidence: what carriers exist, under what observation conditions, or both.
  **Minimum fields (recommended):** (1) observation and measurement conditions, (2) carrier-class and carrier-schema reference, and (3) viewpoint and consumer.
  **Guardrails:** `E-*` SHOULD NOT use RFC deontic keywords, MUST NOT hide a gate predicate (that is `A-*`), and MUST NOT cite `D-*`.
  *(If the sentence is “Role SHALL measure, retain, or expose …”, classify that obligation to **D**, even if it is about evidence.)*

**Step 3 — Triangle decomposition.** If the original sentence mixes (i) an entry condition, (ii) an obligation or commitment, and (iii) an observability expectation (a common failure mode with “guarantee, ensure, approved, or aligned”), decompose it into:

* **A**: the admissibility predicate (what must be true to treat the claim as applicable),
* **D → A**: who is responsible for keeping or ensuring the predicate,
* **E → A**: what evidence or traces are used to adjudicate the predicate.

**Note (claim-classification sanity).** `D-*` claims are authored in the description even when their compliance is audited via `E-*` claims. Auditing via evidence does not move `D-*` into quadrant E.

**Guideline.** Keep gate semantics independent of specific evidence carriers: write the gate predicate in `A-*`, then bind observability in `E-*` that references the gate (`E → A`). `A-*` claims MUST NOT reference `E-*` (no upward dependencies), even though `E-*` is used to adjudicate gate satisfaction.

**Step 4 — Link by ID, not by paraphrase.** Supported directions (no upward deps):

* `A-*` may cite `L-*`
* `E-*` may cite `L-*` and `A-*`
* `D-*` may cite `L-*`, `A-*`, `E-*`
* Unsupported: `L-*` citing anything; `A-*` or `E-*` citing `D-*`.

**Common link motifs (informative).** The most reusable boundary rewrites use the canonical motifs: `D→A`, `E→A`, `D→E`, `A/E→L`, and `D→L`.

**Step 5 — Bind references (minimal A.7 discipline).**

* Place **L** claims in `Signature.Laws` (and mechanism-local semantic laws if present), and **A** claims in `Mechanism.AdmissibilityConditions`.
* Bind **D** claims to accountable role assignments or admitted acting systems and prefer ID references (no restatement of `L-*` / `A-*` content in new words).
* Bind **E** claims to carriers and observation conditions and **SHOULD** include viewpoint and consumer (minimum: conditions + carrier class and schema + consumer and viewpoint).

**Optional drift-control.** Add each L/A/D/E-classified claim verbatim to a Claim Register row (A.6.B:7) with canonical location + references so faces can cite by ID without paraphrase.

**Step 6 — Recompose into readable text.**
Produce two recompositions:

* **Tech recomposition**: a short **L/A/D/E-classified claim bundle** (sometimes called a “claim skeleton”) listing L/A/D/E claims and ID references.
* **Plain recomposition**: a one-paragraph narrative that *summarizes* the bundle and points to IDs (**no new semantics**). If you need a new constraint, add a new atomic L/A/D/E-classified claim; do not smuggle it into Plain.

##### A.6.B:8.4.2 - Anti-pattern (quick)

* **AP-1 Evidence-free guarantees.** “X guarantees Y” with no E-claims.
* **AP-2 Interface-as-promiser.** Non-agent objects “promise or commit”.
* **AP-3 Gate-as-evidence.** Treating the gate predicate (A) as if it were an observation (E).
* **AP-4 Gate-as-law.** Entry predicates as signature “laws or definitions” (L) instead of `A-*`.
* **AP-5 Adjective smuggling.** “fast, secure, approved, or aligned” used instead of qualifiers or slots.
* **AP-6 Paraphrase drift.** Restating L/A content in D or E with changed meaning (instead of citing by ID).
* **AP-7 Deontics in predicates.** RFC keywords (“MUST, SHALL, and related RFC keywords”) used as operators inside `L-*` or `A-*` predicates (should be `D-*` that references `L-*`/`A-*`).
* **AP-8 View-fork semantics.** Recomposition/face text introduces new `L/A/D/E` meaning not present in the L/A/D/E-classified claim set (violates “no new semantics” discipline).
* **AP-9 Applicability-as-gate.** Using `Signature.Applicability` (intended use) as a substitute for `A-*` runtime admission predicates.

##### A.6.B:8.4.3 - Example 1 — Software engineering (SLO-ish API latency)

###### A.6.B:8.4.3.1 - Draft sentence (non-conformant)

> “This API guarantees p95 latency < 200ms.”

###### A.6.B:8.4.3.2 - Atomize + Classify (L/A/D/E)

**L-API-01 (Definition).**
`p95_latency(window W, population P, unit U, method M)` is defined as … (formal measurement definition).
*(Lives in Signature.Laws or a referenced measurement definition pack.)*

**L-API-02 (Interface signature).**
The API endpoints and parameters are as declared (including parameter passing discipline / units).
*(Signature-level structure.)*

**A-API-01 (Gate predicate: admissibility).**
The claim “p95 < 200ms” is admissible **only under** declared load profile + deployment region + sampling method + window:
`AdmissibleLatencyClaim := (region=US) ∧ (concurrency≤X) ∧ (payload≤Y) ∧ (W=5m) ∧ (M=HDRHistogram@v…) ∧ (P=requests that match filter F)`
*(References L-API-01 for definition.)*

**D-API-01 (Commitment).**
`ServiceOwner` SHALL meet the latency target `p95_latency < 200ms` when `A-API-01` holds, adjudicated per `L-API-01` using the carriers and observation conditions in `E-API-01`.
*(References L-API-01 and A-API-01 by ID; does not restate them.)*

**D-API-02 (Operational duty).**
`SRE_oncall` SHALL publish incident notes when the commitment `D-API-01` is violated, and SHALL avoid claiming compliance outside `A-API-01`.
*(References D-API-01 and A-API-01 by ID.)*

**E-API-01 (Evidence / carriers).**
For decisions under `A-API-01`, the following carrier **classes** are produced or observable under the declared observation conditions: trace IDs and span IDs, raw histogram carriers with schema reference, percentile dashboard snapshots, and pinned sampling configuration for window `W`.
**Observation conditions (minimum):** workload profile selector, sampling method and configuration pins, and computation method reference (`L-API-01`).
**Viewpoint and consumer (minimum):** the role assignment, viewpoint, or consumer that uses the carriers to adjudicate the gate, audit commitments, or both (e.g., SRE or performance-reviewer).
*(References `A-API-01` and `L-API-01`; avoids RFC deontics; does not smuggle gates. Note: `E-*` MUST NOT cite `D-*`.)*

**D-API-03 (Duty-to-evidence linkage).**
`Operators` SHALL retain or expose the carrier classes referenced in `E-API-01` for the audit window required by policy.
*(References E-API-01 by ID.)*

**E-API-02 (Observed value claim).**
For interval `Γ_time = [t1..t2]` under conditions pinned to `A-API-01` and using carriers in `E-API-01`, observed `p95_latency = 173ms` (computed per `L-API-01`).
*(References A-API-01, L-API-01 and E-API-01.)*

###### A.6.B:8.4.3.3 - Triangle decomposition (explicit)

* **A-API-01** is “the predicate”.
* **D-API-01 → A-API-01** states the commitment under the gate or envelope.
* **E-API-01 → A-API-01** binds adjudication (carriers used to decide the gate or commitment).
* **D-API-03 → E-API-01** expresses retention and exposure obligations for those carriers.

###### A.6.B:8.4.3.4 - Readable recomposition

**Tech recomposition (L/A/D/E-classified claim bundle, short):**

* `L-API-01` defines p95 latency computation.
* `A-API-01` specifies when the latency claim is admissible.
* `D-API-01` states the commitment under that envelope.
* `E-API-01` lists adjudicable carriers and conditions used to adjudicate `A-API-01` (and therefore any commitments that reference it).
* `D-API-02` assigns operational incident-note duties.
* `D-API-03` assigns retention and exposure duties for carriers in `E-API-01`.
* `E-API-02` reports observed performance under `A-API-01` for `Γ_time=[t1..t2]`.

**Plain recomposition (one paragraph, readable):**
“The API’s latency target uses the p95 definition in **L-API-01** and is only applicable under the declared operating envelope **A-API-01**. The service owner commits to meeting the <200ms target under that envelope (**D-API-01**). Adjudication uses the telemetry carriers listed in **E-API-01**, which operators must retain or expose (**D-API-03**), and the on-call SRE must publish incident notes when the commitment is violated (**D-API-02**). Under that envelope, the observed p95 over `Γ_time=[t1..t2]` was `173ms` (**E-API-02**).”

##### A.6.B:8.4.4 - Example 2 — Mechanical engineering (fit / coaxiality)

###### A.6.B:8.4.4.1 - Draft sentence (non-conformant)

> “This fit ensures coaxiality.”

###### A.6.B:8.4.4.2 - Atomize + Classify

**L-FIT-01 (Definition).**
`coaxiality` is defined relative to a declared base axis and measurement method (datum scheme, instrument, tolerance zone).
*(Truth-conditional: “what it means”.)*

**L-FIT-02 (Interface and boundary structure).**
The boundary relation involves shaft, bushing, datum axis, tolerance class, temperature window, assembly procedure class.
*(Signature-level arity recovery / slots.)*

**A-FIT-01 (Gate predicate).**
The coaxiality claim is admissible only if manufacturing and assembly satisfy the declared process envelope: material batch, temperature window, tool calibration validity, surface finish class, alignment procedure version.
*(Gate predicate; can be checked using evidence, but is not itself evidence.)*

**D-FIT-01 (Duty).**
`ProcessEngineer` SHALL ensure A-FIT-01 holds for the production lot and SHALL not release the lot for use when A-FIT-01 is false.
*(References A-FIT-01.)*

**E-FIT-01 (Evidence carriers).**
Evidence carriers used to adjudicate `A-FIT-01` include CMM reports, tool calibration certificates, assembly logs, temperature traces, and datum scheme pins.
*(References A-FIT-01 and L-FIT-01; avoids RFC deontics.)*

**D-FIT-02 (Duty-to-evidence linkage).**
`QualityEngineer` SHALL retain or expose the carriers referenced in `E-FIT-01` for the production lot.
*(References E-FIT-01 by ID.)*

**E-FIT-02 (Observed).**
For lot `L123` and window `Γ_time=[t1..t2]`, under conditions pinned to `A-FIT-01` and using carriers in `E-FIT-01`, measured coaxiality was within tolerance zone `T` (interpreted per `L-FIT-01`).
*(References A-FIT-01, L-FIT-01, and E-FIT-01.)*

###### A.6.B:8.4.4.3 - Readable recomposition

**Tech bundle:**

* Meaning of coaxiality: `L-FIT-01`.
* Boundary arity and participants: `L-FIT-02`.
* When the claim is admissible: `A-FIT-01`.
* Who is responsible: `D-FIT-01`.
* What we observe and keep as carriers: `E-FIT-01` and measured outcome `E-FIT-02` (with retention duty `D-FIT-02`).

**Plain paragraph:**
“‘Ensures coaxiality’ is made precise by fixing the definition and datum scheme (**L-FIT-01**) and by making the boundary participants explicit (**L-FIT-02**). The coaxiality claim is only applicable under the declared manufacturing and assembly envelope (**A-FIT-01**), which the process engineer is accountable for maintaining (**D-FIT-01**). Compliance is adjudicated using the measurement and process carriers listed in **E-FIT-01**; for lot `L123` over `Γ_time=[t1..t2]`, the observed coaxiality was within tolerance **E-FIT-02**.”

##### A.6.B:8.4.5 - Example 3 — Management (project “approved or aligned”)

###### A.6.B:8.4.5.1 - Draft sentence (non-conformant)

> “The project is approved.”

###### A.6.B:8.4.5.2 - Atomize + Classify

**L-PRJ-01 (Definition).**
`approved(project, approvalKind)` is defined as a relation kind; approval kinds include: “sponsor-signoff”, “stage-gate-pass”, “budget-authorized”, “staffing-assigned”, etc.
*(Truth-conditional: disambiguates kind and polarity.)*

**A-PRJ-01 (Gate predicate: stage entry).**
For starting execution work, `ExecutionAdmissible(project)` holds iff required approvals are present *and* required prerequisites are satisfied (e.g., risk review completed, budget line exists, key roles staffed).
*(This is the real “may start work” gate; references L-PRJ-01 for what counts as approvals.)*

**D-PRJ-01 (Duty).**
`ProjectOwner` SHALL not initiate execution unless `A-PRJ-01` holds, SHALL keep the approval registry current, and SHALL retain or expose the evidence carriers referenced in `E-PRJ-01`.
*(References A-PRJ-01 and E-PRJ-01 by ID.)*

**E-PRJ-01 (Evidence carriers).**
Evidence carriers used to adjudicate `A-PRJ-01` include: signed decision record IDs, meeting minutes pins, budget system references, staffing assignment records, and gate checklist snapshots.
*(References A-PRJ-01; avoids RFC deontics.)*

**E-PRJ-02 (Observed state).**
As of `Γ_time=snapshot(t)`, a resolvable gate-status carrier (e.g., `GateChecklistSnapshot#…`) indicates `A-PRJ-01` holds, with the referenced evidence set pinned as `{DecisionRecord#…, BudgetLine#…, StaffingAssignments#…}` (carrier classes as per `E-PRJ-01`).
*(Observed / pinned state; references `A-PRJ-01` and `E-PRJ-01`; includes carrier instance(s), not just carrier classes.)*

###### A.6.B:8.4.5.3 - Readable recomposition

**Tech bundle:**

* “Approved” is not one relation: `L-PRJ-01` defines approval kinds.
* “May start execution” is a gate predicate: `A-PRJ-01`.
* Owner accountability: `D-PRJ-01`.
* Carriers and adjudication: `E-PRJ-01` and observed snapshot `E-PRJ-02`.

**Plain paragraph:**
“Instead of a generic ‘approved’, we select an explicit approval kind as defined in **L-PRJ-01** and treat ‘may start execution’ as an admissibility gate (**A-PRJ-01**). The project owner is accountable for not starting execution unless that gate holds and for keeping the approval registry current (**D-PRJ-01**). Gate status is adjudicated using the pinned carriers listed in **E-PRJ-01**; as of snapshot `t`, the evidence indicates the gate holds (**E-PRJ-02**).”

##### A.6.B:8.4.6 - A compact “recomposition pattern” you can reuse verbatim

###### A.6.B:8.4.6.1 - Tech register (2–5 lines)

> “This boundary claim is defined by **L-…**, is applicable only under **A-…**, is accountable under **D-…**, and is adjudicated using evidence carriers **E-…**. Observed status or value is **E-…** for `Γ_time=…`.”

###### A.6.B:8.4.6.2 - Plain register (1 paragraph)

> “We mean **[short label]** in the sense of **L-…**. It’s only meant to be used when **A-…** holds. **[Role]** is responsible for maintaining that condition (**D-…**). Whether it holds is checked using **E-…**, and the latest recorded status or value is **E-…**.”
