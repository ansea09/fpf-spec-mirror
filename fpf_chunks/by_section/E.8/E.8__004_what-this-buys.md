### E.8:0.2 - What this buys

`E.8` gives FPF authors one shared pattern shape and one shared authoring discipline: recognition text first, assurance text second, canonical sections present, terminology kept stable, SoTA used as live support rather than decoration, and practical consequences visible before a reader has to reconstruct the architecture.

**First useful move.** Put the working situation, first action-guiding move, practical payoff, ordinary boundary, and heavier-support condition into the recognition text before tightening template details or conformance material.

**Cheap stop.** If the draft already gives a cold reader the working situation, first useful move, practical payoff, ordinary boundary, and nearest heavier support condition, do not add more authoring apparatus just to look mature. Use conformance material to verify that guidance; do not let it replace the guidance.

**Load-bearing authoring extension.** Add heavier assurance, conformance, SoTA, or relation-support material only when the light recognition text would leave a live false claim, unstable governed object, hidden neighbouring-pattern boundary, unsupported practical payoff, or misleading admissible use.

**Maturity rule.** Section completeness is not pattern maturity. A pattern matures when its `Problem frame`, `Solution`, worked cases, boundaries, and conformance checks all point to the same usable action guidance.


**Governed object in plain terms.** The governed object is the authored FPF pattern body: its canonical sections, reader-recognition role, wording discipline, examples, rationale, anti-patterns, SoTA-Echoing, and relations.

**Primary working reader.** The first reader is an FPF author or reviewer shaping pattern prose for later practitioners and managers. The downstream practitioner is the reader the pattern must ultimately serve, so the authoring guide must model the same recognition discipline it requires.
