### A.6.7:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

1. **Anti-pattern: “Family-as-suite”.**
   Using `MechFamilyDescription` to list multiple distinct mechanisms.
   **Fix:** use `MechSuiteDescription` for “many mechanisms”, and keep `MechFamilyDescription` for “many realizations of one mechanism”.

2. **Anti-pattern: “Pack-as-suite”.**
   Naming/using the suite as a `Pack`.
   **Fix:** reserve `Pack` for publication/shipping bundling; use `Suite` for mechanism bundles.

3. **Anti-pattern: “Suite contains admissibility tables”.**
   Duplicating CG‑Spec or embedding CL/Φ/Ψ tables in suite obligations.
   **Fix:** publish pins and references only; keep admissibility content in `...Spec` and policy registries; keep crossing realization in E.18/gate surfaces.

4. **Anti-pattern: “Suite is a hidden gate”.**
   Introducing thresholds, `block`, or `DecisionLog` in the suite.
   **Fix:** suite declares guard formats and required pins; the gate issues decisions.

5. **Anti-pattern: “Implicit calls”.**
   A protocol implies “normalize happens somewhere” without explicit member and pin visibility.
   **Fix:** protocols enumerate steps and required pins; E.18 `Uses` edges remain explicit.
