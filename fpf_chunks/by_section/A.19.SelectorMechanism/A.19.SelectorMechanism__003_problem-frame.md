### A.19.SelectorMechanism:1 - Problem frame

FPF’s Characterization (CHR) suite treats selection as a **distinct mechanism boundary** within the suite (authoritative membership: `A.19.CHR:4.2`).
Suite membership is a **set**; order has no semantics. Any intended ordering is expressed only via `suite_protocols` (`A.19.CHR:4.5`), under suite obligations (`A.19.CHR:4.3`).

Within the suite‑closed protocol, `SelectorMechanism` appears as the `select` stage (after admissible comparison; optional stages remain explicitly optional per `suite_protocols`). The kernel’s role is concept‑level and governed by CN‑Spec and CG‑Spec:

* consume **admissible** comparison outcomes without collapsing them into a hidden scalar,
* apply **explicit** criteria and policy references, and
* return a **selected-set** result whose defaults are policy-bound and whose dated work, actual `Select` application, `SelectionSlot` binding, and evidence-provenance basis can be replayed.

The kernel uses the CHR suite SlotKind lexicon (`A.19.CHR:4.2.1`) to prevent SlotKind drift across specializations and across SoTA wiring layers.
