### A.19.SelectorMechanism:7 - Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑0** | **MechAuthoring discipline:** the canonical SelectorMechanism `Mechanism.Intension` in `A.19.SelectorMechanism:4.1` MUST satisfy `A.6.1` `U.MechAuthoring` and the relevant `CC‑UM.*` checks; this pattern does not override the `U.Mechanism.Intension` shape. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑1** | **Single governing pattern:** the canonical SelectorMechanism `U.Mechanism.Intension` MUST be governed by `A.19.SelectorMechanism:4.1`. Any other SelectorMechanism “card” text MUST be reduced to Tell+Cite referencing this governing pattern section. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑2** | **Set‑return default:** a conformant `Select` MUST be set‑returning by default; it MUST NOT silently collapse partial orders or incomparabilities to a single winner. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑3** | **No hidden thresholds/constants:** a conformant SelectorMechanism publication MUST NOT smuggle thresholds, weights, dominance rules, tie‑breakers, or default `PortfolioMode` fields. Selection‑level commitments MUST be explicit in `CriteriaSlot` and/or explicit policy routing (e.g., via `TaskSignatureSlot`). Acceptance thresholds remain governed by `AcceptanceClauses` / `TaskSignature` / `GateProfile` records and MUST be applied only via `SelectEligibility`. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑4** | **No hidden scalarization:** if `ComparisonResultSlot` is set‑valued or partial, a conformant publication MUST consume it as such; scalar summaries are report‑only unless explicitly promoted by policy outside suite closure. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑5** | **Evidence gating:** a conformant publication MUST guard selection via `SelectEligibility` with `GuardDecision ∈ {pass|degrade|abstain}`; missing/unknown evidence MUST NOT yield `pass`. If `MinimalEvidenceSlot?` is absent, the guard MUST evaluate against `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence`. Any candidate‑level filtering triggered by evidence MUST be explicit and auditable, not silent. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑6** | **SlotKind discipline:** SlotKind tokens used in the SelectorMechanism intension MUST come from the CHR SlotKind lexicon (`A.19.CHR:4.2.1`). New SlotKinds require lexicon extension first. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑7** | **Transport discipline:** cross‑context and cross‑plane selection MUST be explicit via Bridge+CL/ReferencePlane; penalties route to `R_eff` only, and crossings MUST be auditable. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑8** | **Audit surface:** Audit MUST record `CNSpecRef.edition`, `CGSpecRef.edition`, and the effective evidence policy (record `MinimalEvidenceRef` when overridden; else cite `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence`); MUST record `TaskSignatureRef.edition` when `TaskSignatureSlot?` is used; and MUST record a stable identity for the resulting `SelectionSlot`. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑9** | **P2W separation:** planned baseline plan items MUST bind editions and policy pins (A.15.3 + CHR P2W hook); these bindings MUST NOT be invented as run-time decisions inside the suite protocol. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑10** | **Specialisation-chain discipline:** any `⊑/⊑⁺` specialization of SelectorMechanism MUST satisfy `A.6.1:4.2.1`, especially SlotKind invariance and “no new mandatory inputs” to inherited `Select`. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑11** | **Guard + gate separation:** `SelectorMechanism` MUST NOT publish `GateDecision`/`DecisionLog`; the mechanism‑level guard is `SelectEligibility` returning `GuardDecision := {pass|degrade|abstain}` and follows guard lexeme reservations (`A.19.CHR:4.3.2`). |
| GateDecision leakage         | `Select` emits `GateDecision` or writes a decision log                          | Keep gate decisions in gate patterns; selection uses `SelectEligibility` + `Audit` pins only                                                       |
