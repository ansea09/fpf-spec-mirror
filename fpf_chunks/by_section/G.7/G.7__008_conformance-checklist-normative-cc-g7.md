### G.7:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative) — **CC‑G7**

| ConformanceId             | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Purpose                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CC‑G7‑CoreRef**         | `G.7` is conformant only if it satisfies the effective `G.Core` obligations declared by the `GCoreLinkageManifest` in **§4.1** (after nil‑elision and expansion of profile/set/pinset ids), including any explicit deltas listed there. | Make universal invariants one governing definition and enforce citation‑based reuse.       |
| **CC‑G7‑BCT‑1**           | For any active `TradPairId` using this calibration kit for cross‑Tradition reuse, a `BridgeCalibrationTable (BCT)` **MUST** exist, declare a `FreshnessWindowRef`, and provide `RowEntry` records that cite, at minimum: `RowEntryId`, `ComparableConstructId`, `RowScopeId`, `BridgeCardId[]`, `RowCL_min`, `PlanePins {ReferencePlane(src), ReferencePlane(tgt)}`, `PolicyPins {Φ(CL)}` (and `Ψ(CL^k)?`, `Φ_plane?` when applicable), plus `{RegressionSetId, SentinelSetId}`. | Ensure the kit exists as an auditable object rather than a prose matrix.       |
| **CC‑G7‑BridgeCard‑1**    | Any bridge published by G.7 **MUST** be consumable as an **F.9** `BridgeCard` and **MUST** be SenseCell‑anchored (directly or via explicit SenseCell anchor refs).                                                                                                                        | Prevent “Context‑only” or ambiguous bridges.                                   |
| **CC‑G7‑UTS‑1**           | G.7 outputs **MUST** mint/publish UTS‑citable ids (NameCards/twin labels as applicable) for (a) each BridgeCard (or its NameCard) and (b) each GateCrossing/crossing row that makes bridge use checkable; and **MUST** expose the resulting `UTSRowId[]` in the BCT/Ledger/crossing bundles. *(UTS discipline is delegated to `CC‑GCORE‑UTS‑1`.)* | Make bridge calibration externally citable and checkable.                      |
| **CC‑G7‑RowScope‑1**      | Every BCT row **MUST** declare its `RowScopeId` (what notion of “sameness” is claimed), and any loss notes **MUST** be recorded as citable artefacts (refs/ids), not only narrative text.                                                                                                 | Keep reuse honest and locally bounded.                                         |
| **CC‑G7‑CLRegime‑1**      | Every BCT row **MUST** record `RowCL_min` (and `RowCL_k_min?`, `RowCL_plane_min?` where applicable) and apply the admissibility regime from §4.2.1: `≥2` admissible; `=1` only with cited `WaiverRef[]`; `=0` forbidden for reuse. The honesty rule must be satisfied: ≥1 counterexample for `≤2`, and an explicit stated‑absence disclosure for `=3` when no counterexample is cited. | Make CL/waiver/plane regimes explicit and auditable at kit level.              |
| **CC‑G7‑SCRLinkage‑1**    | Whenever bridge calibration is cited in SCR/Evidence surfaces, the citation **MUST** include `{BridgeCardId[]}` (or `UTSRowId[]` for the bridge artefacts), an explicit row locator (`RowEntryId` or equivalent), `{BCT.id, RegressionSetId}`, and the active policy id pins `{Φ(CL), Ψ(CL^k)?, Φ_plane?}` (ids only; representation governed elsewhere). | Prevent “pins exist but are not visible/auditable” failure mode.               |
| **CC‑G7‑SoSLOG‑Pins‑1**   | When `G.7:Ext.SoSLogClauses` is in use, G.7 outputs **MUST** expose the cited SoS‑LOG rule ids and the relevant `PathId/PathSliceId` evidence citations; any change in those pins **MUST** be RSCR‑relevant per `CC‑GCORE‑TRIG‑1…TRIG‑4`.                                               | Keep cross‑Tradition reuse explainable without embedding C.23 semantics.        |
| **CC‑G7‑Acceptance‑1**    | When `G.7:Ext.AcceptanceHooks` is in use, G.7 outputs **MUST** expose the Acceptance clause ids/policy ids used as gates; thresholds/unknown handling remain governed by Acceptance; any change **MUST** be RSCR‑relevant per `CC‑GCORE‑TRIG‑1…TRIG‑4`.                                           | Keep thresholds and unknowns out of bridges while preserving auditability.     |
| **CC‑G7‑RowBottleneck‑1** | If a comparable construct row aggregates multiple bridge cells, row summaries (e.g., `RowCL_min`) **MUST** follow bottleneck discipline (F.7) and cite a counterexample whenever a cell carries a loss note.                                                                              | Forbid “CL averaging” and enforce loss‑aware summaries.                        |
| **CC‑G7‑PolicyPins‑1**    | G.7 outputs **MUST** publish the *policy id pins* required to audit penalty routing and plane effects (ids only), as required by `CC‑GCORE‑LINK‑1/2` and `CC‑GCORE‑PEN‑1`. G.7 MUST NOT duplicate policy tables or redefine penalty semantics.                                           | Keep penalty routing auditable while preserving single‑governing-pattern policy semantics. |
| **CC‑G7‑GateCrossing‑1**  | Any published crossing rows that rely on bridges **MUST** be checkable via GateCrossing/CrossingBundle harnesses (E.18/A.21): required pins are present; lexical constraints and lane purity checks are runnable.                                                                        | Make crossings checkable, not narrative.                                       |
| **CC‑G7‑Sentinels‑1**     | G.7 **MUST** register `BridgeSentinel` entries for bridges used by live scopes and **MUST** emit typed RSCR triggers (canonical `RSCRTriggerKindId`; see `CC‑GCORE‑TRIG‑1…TRIG‑4`) on calibration‑relevant edits, scoped to the watched `PathSliceId[]` or `PatternScopeId[]`, with the minimum payload pins from §4.1. | Enable targeted refresh rather than pack‑wide reruns.                          |
| **CC‑G7‑QD‑Pins‑1**       | When `G.7:Ext.QDParityPins` is in use, G.7 outputs **MUST** include `{DescriptorMapRef.edition, DistanceDefRef.edition, InsertionPolicyRef}` and treat any change to those pins as RSCR‑relevant per `CC‑GCORE‑TRIG‑1…TRIG‑4`.                                                          | Prevent silent QD telemetry drift.                                             |
| **CC‑G7‑DHC‑Units‑1**     | When AlignmentDensity (or related DHC accounts) are reported, G.7 outputs **MUST** (a) restrict the counted bridge set to rows with `RowCL_min ≥ 2` (treat `CL=3` as “free substitution”, `CL=2` as “guarded” for reporting), (b) include declared units, and (c) cite the relevant DHC method semantics (C.21). G.7 MUST NOT invent arithmetic over ordinal/illegal surfaces. | Keep dashboards and discipline‑health metrics lawful and interpretable.        |
