### G.7:3 - Forces

| Force                                    | Tension                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Comparability vs local authority**     | Enable comparisons across Traditions ↔ avoid overriding Context‑local meaning.                                                                                            |
| **Auditability vs authoring throughput** | Require explicit artefacts, losses, and pins ↔ keep the calibration procedure light enough to be used.                                                                    |
| **Targeted refresh vs safety**           | Emit path‑local RSCR triggers ↔ ensure triggers are typed and carry enough payload pins for audit and rerun planning.                                                     |
| **Plane awareness vs “one story”**       | Explicitly surface `ReferencePlane` and plane penalties ↔ avoid turning plane discussion into a second semantics of “sameness”.                                           |
| **QD comparability vs metric drift**     | Enable cross‑context reporting of archive/illumination telemetry ↔ enforce edition‑aware pins for descriptor/distance/policies only when those modes are actually in use. |
