### C.25:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | What it looks like | How FPF prevents it |
|---|---|---|
| **One-number `-ility`** | `Resilience = 82` with no declaration of what is being measured and what scope/scenario is intended. | `CC-C.25-2` requires a Q-Bundle when the family is composite. |
| **Scope as metric** | The claim treats wider applicability as a higher quality value rather than as a larger USM set. | `CC-C.25-3` keeps scope set-valued and non-CHR. |
| **Mechanism equals quality** | Presence of a mechanism or certificate is reported as if it were the measurement itself. | `CC-C.25-4` keeps mechanism/status slots distinct from measures. |
| **Ambiguous guard** | The reader cannot tell which coverage, thresholds, windows or mechanisms make the claim true. | Make those conditions and their kinds recoverable, in ordinary prose or explicit slots. |
