### A.2.8:1 - Problem frame

FPF needs to express boundary governance and socio-technical obligations in a way that is:

* **grounded in an accountable role, role assignment, or party** (someone is accountable),
* **scope-and-window explicit** (where/when the commitment holds),
* **reference-based** (no paraphrase drift; refer to claim IDs),
* **adjudicable** (if intended to be checkable, it has an evidence story).

In practice, texts use “MUST/SHALL/should”, “commits to”, “guarantees”, “SLA”, “contract”, etc. Without a stable kernel object for the deontic commitment relation, authors either:

* assign agency to descriptions (“the API guarantees…”),
* smuggle admissibility gates into deontics (or vice versa),
* treat evidence as semantic truth,
* or create multiple inconsistent “contracts” across faces.

A.6.B provides L/A/D/E claim-classification discipline, and A.6.C provides contract-language unpacking, but both benefit from a **kernel-level** object that pins down what a `U.Commitment` is structurally (so “contract/binding” rhetoric does not leak back in as ontology).
