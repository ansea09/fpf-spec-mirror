### G.8:10 - Consequences

* **Positive:** `G.5` receives a stable, citable, selector‑facing artefact without importing rule semantics or threshold logic.
* **Positive:** Audit and refresh become tractable: pins, crossings, evidence paths, and trigger kinds are explicit.
* **Positive:** Maturity remains non‑scalar, reducing illegitimate aggregation and “readiness theater”.
* **Negative:** Requires stricter authoring discipline (UTS publication, pin completeness, explicit wiring).
* **Negative:** If evidence paths are not maintained (`G.6` absent), auditability degrades and downstream must rely on references with lower evidence-support class, or abstain.
