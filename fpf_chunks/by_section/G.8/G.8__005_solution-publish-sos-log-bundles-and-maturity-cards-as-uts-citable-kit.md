### G.8:4 - Solution — Publish SoS‑LOG bundles and maturity cards as UTS‑citable kit

#### G.8:4.1 - G.Core linkage (normative)

**Builds on:** `G.Core` (Part‑G core invariants; citation/delegation hub)

**GCoreLinkageManifest (normative; size‑controlled).**
*(Canonical shape, Nil‑elision, and Expansion rule are per `G.Core:4.2`.)*

**Separation rule (Phase‑2).** Method‑/generator‑specific pins are **normatively specified** only inside `Extensions` as `GPatternExtension` modules (see `G.8:5.*`). The bundle/ledger schema may mention such fields only as **extension‑gated optionals**, with the authoritative pin/edition/policy requirements stated in the corresponding extension block. The core linkage manifest lists only base‑kit pins and Part‑G‑wide linkage.

`GCoreLinkageManifest := ⟨
CoreConformanceProfileIds := {
GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.AuthoringBase,
GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.TriStateGuard,
GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.UTSWhenPublicIdsMinted,
GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.ShippingBoundary
},

RSCRTriggerSetIds := { GCoreTriggerSetId.EvidenceGraphKit },

CorePinSetIds := {
GCorePinSetId.PartG.AuthoringMinimal,
},

CorePinsRequired := {
  // Public ids governed by this pattern (strengthen conditional pins where G.8 publishes UTS publication units)
  UTSRowId[],                    // bundle/ledger/card rows + any referenced UTS rows
  SoS‑LOGBundleRef,
  SoSLogRuleId[],
  MethodFamilyId,
  RegistrationContext,

  // Closed value sets (ids only; UTS-registered)
  DegradeModeEnum,
  MaturityRungs,

  // Maturity ladder pins
  MaturityCardRef,               // required; recommended: published as separate UTS artefact
  MaturityRungId?,               // iff a specific rung is asserted at packaging/run-time

  // Evidence / provenance pins
  A10EvidenceGraphRef?[],        // packaging-time A.10 carriers (when PathId/PathSliceId not yet available)
  EvidenceGraphId?,              // iff resolvable to G.6 EvidenceGraph
  PathId[]/PathSliceId[]?,       // run-time ledgers typically have them

  // Authoring traceability (SoTA-of-description)
  AuthoringMethodDescriptionRefs?[],  // edition-pinned method-description refs
},

DefaultsConsumed := {
DefaultId.PortfolioMode,
DefaultId.DominanceRegime,
DefaultId.GammaFoldForR_eff
},
⟩`

*(RSCR payload pins typically include: `SoS‑LOGBundleRef`, `SoSLogRuleId[]`, `MaturityRungId?`, and `EvidenceGraphId/PathId/PathSliceId?`.
Crossing payload pins (Bridge/CL/Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane) are introduced **only when reuse is asserted**, via `G.8:Ext.BridgeReuseWiring`.
Method-/generator‑specific payload pins are listed only inside the relevant `GPatternExtension` blocks in `G.8:5`.)*

*(Conditionality note for defaults.)* Include `DefaultId.GammaFoldForR_eff` in `DefaultsConsumed` **only if** the bundle/ledger exports aggregated `R_eff` summaries (otherwise Nil‑elide it).

#### G.8:4.2 - Kit: objects and naming discipline (LEX heads; twin‑register safe)

**Objects / surfaces (pattern-governed).**

* **`SoS‑LOG.Rule`**
  A rule id that denotes an executable tri‑state decision schema `{pass | degrade(mode) | abstain}` for `(TaskSignature, MethodFamily)`. *(“pass” may be described as “admit” in prose, but the normative tri‑state vocabulary is `G.Core`’s `{pass|degrade|abstain}`.)*
  **Semantics are governed by `C.23`.** `G.8` only packages rule ids and binding pins.

* **`SoS‑LOGBundle@Context`**
  A selector‑facing, notation‑independent packaging object published to UTS.

* **`AdmissibilityLedger@Context`**
  A run‑time ledger view that records admissibility outcomes, cited evidence paths, branch tokens, and the pins required for audit/refresh.

* **`MethodFamily.MaturityCardDescription@Context`**
  A maturity ladder description published as a citable artefact: **ordinal/poset**, closed rungs, `ReferencePlane` declared; no thresholds inside.

**Naming discipline (E.10 + “Spaces ≠ Maps”).**

* Technical heads are normative; Plain twins are didactic only and MUST NOT cross kinds.
* Do **not** alias `CharacteristicSpace` and `DescriptorMap`.

  * `DescriptorMapRef` is a **map‑reference** (typically used with QD archives).
  * `CharacteristicSpaceRef` is a **space‑reference** (grid/cell semantics, if used).
* Editions are pinned on `…Ref.edition` fields (not on informal names).

#### G.8:4.3 - `SoS‑LOGBundle@Context` schema (conceptual; notation‑independent)

A conforming bundle is a UTS‑published object whose internal representation is free, but whose **field meanings** are stable:

```
SoS-LOGBundle@Context :=
⟨
  UTS.id := SoS‑LOGBundleRef,
  Edition,

  // Scope + spec pins (from GCorePinSetId.PartG.AuthoringMinimal)
  CG-FrameContext,
  entityOfConcern := ⟨GroundingHolon, ReferencePlane⟩,
  CNSpecRef.edition,
  CGSpecRef.edition,

  MethodFamilyId,
  RegistrationContext,

  SoSLogRuleId[] ,               // ids only; semantics governed by C.23
  ClosedEnums: {DegradeModeEnum, MaturityRungs},  // ids only; UTS-registered closed value sets
  A10EvidenceGraphRef?[] ,        // packaging-time evidence carriers (A.10 anchors) when paths are not yet stable
  MaturityCardRef ,               // UTS ref to maturity card (required; may be embedded but MUST be citable)
  MaturityRungId? ,               // if a specific rung is asserted at packaging time

  // Optional: Acceptance wiring (thresholds remain governed by G.4)
  AcceptanceClauseId[]? ,

  // Optional: Evidence wiring (for later audit & rung transition justification)
  EvidenceGraphId? ,
  PathId[]/PathSliceId[]? ,

  // Optional: cross-context or cross-plane wiring (only when reuse is asserted)
  BridgeId/BridgeCardId? ,
  CL/CL^k/CL^plane? ,
  Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane policy-ids? ,

  // Optional: selector semantics pins (explicit value or resolved via DefaultGoverningDefinitionIndex)
  PortfolioMode? ,
  DominanceRegime? ,

  // Optional: QD / OEE pins (only when those surfaces are declared)
  CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition? ,
  DescriptorMapRef.edition? ,
  DistanceDefRef.edition? ,
  EmitterPolicyRef? ,
  InsertionPolicyRef? ,
  // Optional: Open-ended pins (only when those surfaces are declared)
  GeneratorFamilyId? ,
  EnvironmentValidityRegionId? ,
  CouplerPolicyId? ,
  TransferRulesRef.edition? ,

  // Optional: branch/failure wiring (policy-bound)
  FailureBehaviorPolicyId? ,
  SoSLogBranchId[]? ,

  // Optional: authoring traceability (SoTA-of-description)
  AuthoringMethodDescriptionRefs?[] ,

  Notes

```

**Bundle discipline (normative intent; semantics delegated):**

* `SoS‑LOGBundle@Context` **does not introduce** new legality or normalization rules; it cites the pinned references above.
* Thresholds and numeric gates are cited by id from `G.4` Acceptance (no embedding inside the bundle).
* If cross-context or cross-plane reuse is asserted, crossing pins are made explicit (Bridge/CL/Φ policy ids), and evidence paths are citable when available.

**Binding obligations B1–B5 (packaging‑only; wiring‑only; semantics delegated):**

* **B1 — Evidence wiring.** At packaging time the bundle SHOULD provide resolvable evidence refs (typically `A10EvidenceGraphRef?[]` and/or `EvidenceGraphId?`). At run time, admissibility outcomes SHOULD cite `PathId/PathSliceId` when available (`G.6`), so rung transitions and `degrade/abstain` traces are audit‑stable.
* **B2 — CL/plane routing pins.** When reuse across Context or plane is asserted, the bundle/ledger MUST pin the relevant Bridge/CL/Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane policy ids (reference‑only; resolvable per `F.8:8.1`) and MUST respect the core penalty routing (penalties affect `R_eff` only; `F/G` invariance via `G.Core`).
* **B3 — `PortfolioMode`/QD fields.** If the bundle/ledger exposes `PortfolioMode`/QD fields (e.g., `PortfolioMode=Archive`), it MUST pin the descriptor/distance/insertion/emitter artefacts (editions/policies as applicable). Illumination remains **report‑only** unless explicitly promoted by a `G.4` governing-pattern policy id that is pinned and recorded in the run‑time trace.
* **B4 — Open‑ended fields.** If the bundle binds an open‑ended generator family, it MUST pin `GeneratorFamilyId` and `TransferRulesRef.edition` (and any validity region/coupler policy ids when used). Unknown transfer validity MUST be recorded as `degrade`/branching, not as an ad‑hoc fourth status.
* **B5 — Telemetry hooks.** On any material telemetry event (illumination increase, archive insertion, probe accounting update, open‑ended coverage/regret proxy update), the emitted telemetry pins SHOULD include the controlling policy ids plus the relevant edition pins (e.g., `DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, `TransferRulesRef.edition`) and, when available, `PathSliceId` to keep RSCR planning auditable.

#### G.8:4.4 - `AdmissibilityLedger@Context` (run‑time view; selector‑facing)

A conforming ledger is a UTS‑published view (or a view‑projection of a Work/Audit artefact) with rows of the form:

`⟨ MethodFamilyId, SoSLogRuleId, GuardDecision ∈ {pass|degrade|abstain}, DegradeMode?/SoSLogBranchId[]?, MaturityRungId?, AcceptanceClauseId[]?, EvidencePathRefs?, CrossingPins?, PortfolioMode?, DominanceRegime?, Edition ⟩`

Where `EvidencePathRefs` are typically `PathId[]/PathSliceId[]` when `G.6` is in use (or resolvable), and “CrossingPins” are the explicit Bridge/CL/Φ policy pins when reuse is asserted.

#### G.8:4.5 - Maturity ladder as a citable poset (published card)

`MethodFamily.MaturityCardDescription@Context` is published with:

* closed rungs (UTS‑registered identifiers),
* `Scale kind = ordinal` and a declared `ReferencePlane`,
* (optional) explicit poset edges / precedence constraints,
* rung transition justifications that cite evidence paths (typically `G.6` paths).

This card is a **description** suitable for dispatch/audit and refresh; it is not a competing governing spec ref.

#### G.8:4.6 - Interfaces (minimal I/O standard; conceptual)
