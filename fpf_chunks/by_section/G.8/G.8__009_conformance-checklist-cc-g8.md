### G.8:8 - Conformance Checklist (CC‑G8)

* **CC‑G8‑CoreRef (G.Core conformance bridge).**
  A conforming `G.8` SHALL satisfy the **effective** set of `CC‑GCORE‑*` obligations implied by `G.8:4.1` (expanded per `G.Core:4.2`), including required pins, trigger sets, and Default Governing Definition Index citation.

* **CC‑G8‑1 (No thresholds in LOG).**
  Any numeric gate, maturity floor, or threshold SHALL be authored as a `G.4` Acceptance artefact and cited by id; the LOG bundle/ladder SHALL NOT embed thresholds.

* **CC‑G8‑2 (Tri‑state discipline; delegated).**
  Guard outcomes SHALL obey the tri‑state domain and unknown handling defined in `G.Core` (delegation to `CC‑GCORE‑GUARD‑1`).
  Any sandbox/probe‑only behaviour SHALL be represented as an explicit `C.23` branch and MUST pin (and record) the controlling policy id (typically an E/E‑LOG policy id via `C.19`), rather than inventing a fourth status or silently coercing unknowns.

* **CC‑G8‑3 (Path citation when evidence is path‑addressable).**
  When `G.6` is in use (or resolvable), every recorded `pass/degrade/abstain` outcome in the `AdmissibilityLedger` MUST cite `PathId/PathSliceId` (run‑time). At packaging time, the bundle/ledger SHALL at minimum provide resolvable evidence refs (e.g., `EvidenceGraphId?` + anchor refs).

* **CC‑G8‑4 (Crossing visibility and penalty routing; delegated).**
  Any cross-Context or cross-plane reuse asserted by the bundle/ledger SHALL satisfy the core crossing visibility and penalty routing invariants (delegation to `CC‑GCORE‑CROSS‑1` and `CC‑GCORE‑PEN‑1`).

* **CC‑G8‑5 (PortfolioMode/dominance hygiene; delegated).**
  The bundle/ledger SHALL treat `PortfolioMode` and dominance fields as pinned inputs and SHALL cite the governing definition for each omitted default through `G.Core.DefaultGoverningDefinitionIndex` (delegation to `CC‑GCORE‑DEF‑1` and `CC‑GCORE‑SET‑1`; governing definitions include `CC‑G5.23` for `DefaultId.PortfolioMode` and `CC‑G5.28` for `DefaultId.DominanceRegime`). It MUST NOT restate default values locally.
  If the bundle/ledger records telemetry that could influence dispatch (e.g., illumination/QD/OEE/open‑ended proxies), such telemetry SHALL remain report‑only unless explicitly promoted by a `G.4` governing-pattern policy id that is pinned and recorded in the run‑time trace.

* **CC‑G8‑6 (QD/OEE edition discipline).**
  When QD/OEE surfaces are declared, the bundle/ledger MUST pin the relevant editions and policies (`DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, insertion/emitter policies, and `TransferRulesRef.edition` when applicable).
  `CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition` is **required iff** cell boundaries / de‑dup rules / parity depend on the space definition, and MUST NOT be used as a substitute for `DescriptorMapRef.edition`.

* **CC‑G8‑7 (Maturity is ordinal/poset).**
  Maturity ladders SHALL be authored as ordinal/poset descriptions with **closed** rung ids (`MaturityRungs`, UTS‑registered) and a declared `ReferencePlane`, and SHALL be published as a citable UTS artefact (editioned; twin‑register safe).
  Rung transitions, when asserted, MUST be justifiable by citable evidence paths (when available).

* **CC‑G8‑8 (Spaces ≠ Maps).**
  `CharacteristicSpace` and `DescriptorMap` SHALL remain strictly distinct kinds; naming and twin‑register discipline must be respected.

* **CC‑G8‑9 (Notational independence).**
  The bundle, ledger, and maturity card SHALL remain notation‑independent (per `E.5.2`); any serialization choice is non‑normative and belongs outside Part‑G core.

* **CC‑G8‑10 (MOO cross‑reference).**
  When a LOG bundle is used to drive or justify a produced selected-set outcome, the producing Work/Audit artefact SHOULD cite the controlling mechanism ids (e.g., parity/shipping/refresh artefact ids) and relevant policy pins; no “black box” provenance.

* **CC‑G8‑11 (SoTA‑of‑description trace).**
  If authoring methods (e.g., discovery, clustering, summarisation) materially shaped rule text or rung definitions, the bundle/card SHOULD cite their method description refs (edition‑pinned) to support cross‑stance traceability.
