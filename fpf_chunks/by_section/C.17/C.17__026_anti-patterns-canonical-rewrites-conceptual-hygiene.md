### C.17:23 - Anti‑patterns & canonical rewrites (conceptual hygiene)

1. **characteristic‑speak.** “Along the novelty characteristic…” → **Rewrite:** “Along the **Novelty characteristic** (ordinal; higher is better)…”.
2. **Pretty hulls.** Drawing a convex hull and calling it a frontier → **Rewrite:** compute Pareto under declared characteristic polarities.
3. **Ordinal arithmetic.** Averaging ranks or Likert values → **Rewrite:** either treat as **ordinal** and use **order‑safe** operators, or justify an interval mapping via MM‑CHR evidence.
4. **Proxy tyranny.** Single composite index driving choice unseen → **Rewrite:** publish **primitive characteristics**, index formula, and sensitivity.
5. **Policy‑as‑math.** “10% wild bets” as a rule → **Rewrite:** declare an **exploration dynamics** tied to value‑of‑information; if keeping a heuristic, label it as such.
6. **Global meaning.** Porting a profile from another Context by name → **Rewrite:** attach a **Bridge** with CL and loss notes; adjust trust, not scales.
7. **Plan‑profile blur.** Putting milestones into profiles → **Rewrite:** move schedules to `U.WorkPlan`; keep CS for *how options compare*, not *how to execute*.
