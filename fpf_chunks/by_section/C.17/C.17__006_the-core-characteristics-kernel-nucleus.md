### C.17:5 - The Core Characteristics (kernel nucleus)

Each characteristic is specified per **MM‑CHR (C.16)** with: **name**, **intent**, **carrier**, **polarity**, **scale type**, **measurement template**, **evidence**, **scope (USM)**, and **didactic cues**. *Context profiles MAY add characteristics; kernel characteristics MAY NOT be removed without a Bridge.*

#### C.17:5.1 - `Novelty@context` — “How unlike the known set is this?”

* **Intent.** Quantify **distinctness** of the outcome relative to **`U.ReferenceBase`** (global or targeted slice).
* **Carrier.** `U.Episteme` (the outcome).
* **Polarity.** Higher is “more novel.”
* **Scale.** **\[0, 1]**; ratio (0 = duplicate under kernel; 1 = maximally distant).
* **Measurement template (normative pattern):**

  1. Declare **ReferenceBase** `B` and **TimeWindow** window.
  2. Declare **SimilarityKernel** `σ` and its invariances.
  3. Compute **`Novelty@context := 1 − max_{b∈B} sim_σ(outcome, b)`**, or a robust variant (top‑k mean).
  4. Publish **sensitivity note** (how results shift with kernel/`B`).
* **Evidence.** Kernel/version id; top‑k neighbours with distances; ablation on invariances.
* **Scope hooks (USM).** `B` **must** be a declared **slice**; Cross‑context use needs a **Bridge** with **CL** and **loss notes**.
* **Didactic cues.**

  * **Not** “randomness.” Noise has high novelty, low value.
  * **Local, not global.** Novelty is **to this Context now**, not timeless originality.

#### C.17:5.2 - `Use‑Value` *(alias: `ValueGain`)* — “What good did this add under our objective?”

* **Intent.** Quantify **benefit** vs a baseline objective (Decsn‑CAL utility, Service acceptance, KPI).
* **Carrier.** Outcome (episteme) with **Work** evidence.
* **Polarity.** Higher is better.
* **Scale.** Interval/ratio, unit **declared by the Context** (e.g., ΔSNR, % defects, profit/period).
* **Measurement templates (pick one):**

  * **Measured:** `ValueGain := metric_after − metric_before` (declare counterfactual method).
  * **Predicted:** `E[ValueGain | model]` with error bars; update post‑run.
  * **Evidence.**  Declared **objective/criterion**; measurements or credible predictions; counterfactual method (A/B, back‑test, causal inference).
  * **Scope.** State the **context window** used for the objective; claims outside that window are **informative only**.
  * **Didactic cues.**

  * Value is **relative to stated objective**; if the objective is wrong, the value reflects it.
  * Keep **counterfactual discipline**; otherwise “gain” is storytelling.

#### C.17:5.3 - `Surprise` — “How improbable under our learned world?”

* **Intent.** Capture **unexpectedness** given **`U.GenerativePrior`**.
* **Carrier.** Outcome.
* **Polarity.** Higher surprise = more unexpected.
* **Scale.** **bits** or **nats**: `Surprise := −log p_prior(outcome)`.
* **Measurement template:**

  1. Declare **GenerativePrior** (training slice, model class).
  2. Encode outcome for the prior; compute likelihood proxy.
  3. Publish calibration curve (reliability diagram / PIT histogram).
* **Evidence.** Model cards; fit metrics; OOD diagnostics; refresh policy.
* **Scope.** Training slice declared as **ContextSlice**; Bridges penalise **R** (trust), not the value itself (A.2.6).
* **Didactic cues.**

  * **Novelty vs Surprise:** high novelty under one kernel may be low surprise under a broad prior; publish both.

#### C.17:5.4 - `ConstraintFit` — “Did it honour the non‑negotiables?”

* **Intent.** Ensure **mandatory constraints** (safety, ethics, standards, SLOs) are satisfied.
* **Carrier.** Outcome + Work evidence.
* **Polarity.** Higher is **better** (1 = all mandatory satisfied).
* **Scale.** **\[0, 1]**, ratio or pass/fail.
* **Measurement template:** declare **set `C_must`** (Norm‑CAL / Service acceptance), compute **`ConstraintFit := |{c∈C_must : pass(c)}| / |C_must|`**; optionally weight per criticality.
* **Evidence.** Checklists, tests, audits; Who/Role performed the **SpeechActs** (approvals/waivers).
* **Scope.** Constraints are **context‑local**; Cross‑context requires **Bridge**; waivers are **SpeechAct Work** with RSG gates (A.2.5).
* **Interpretation note.** Low `ConstraintFit` signals tension with declared **must‑constraints** and warrants reframing or redesign; **this pattern does not prescribe go/no‑go rules**.

#### C.17:5.5 - `Diversity_P` *(declared retained-set / portfolio-level)* — “Are we exploring the space?”

* **Intent.** At the **set** level, avoid myopic exploitation; promote **coverage**.
* **Carrier.** A **set** of outcomes.
* **Polarity.** Higher means **broader coverage** (not “better” per se).
* **Scale.** Set‑functional; Context defines metric (e.g., **average pairwise distance**, **k‑cover** over features).
* **Template.** Declare **kernel** and **covering policy**; compute score and **coverage map (illumination)**; relate to **USM ClaimScopes**.
* **Alignment note.** The **illumination/coverage** view corresponds to *IlluminationScore* used by **B.5.2.1 NQD‑Generate**; no separate characteristic is introduced here—measure it as part of `Diversity_P`.
* **Evidence.** Distance matrix/cover plots; sensitivity to kernel.
* **Didactic cue.** Use **Diversity\_P** to **shape portfolios**, not to pick single winners.
* **Marginal gain (for generators)** — normative. For a candidate h and current set S, ΔDiversity_P(h | S) := Diversity_P(S ∪ {h}) − Diversity_P(S). Contexts using NQD SHALL compute D as this marginal and publish the Diversity_P definition alongside the CharacteristicSpace/kernel and TimeWindow.

**Heterogeneity Characterisation**
* FamilyCoverage  (polarity ↑) — count of distinct domain‑families covered by a declared retained set, portfolio, or triad; unit: families; window: declared.
* MinInterFamilyDistance (polarity ↑) — min distance between selected families in DescriptorMap for that declared retained set, portfolio, or triad; unit: per DistanceDef; window: declared.
* AliasRisk (polarity ↓) — collinearity/near‑duplicate risk indicator for contextual signatures; unit: score (0–1) with policy id.

**Lexical special case (F.18 naming).**
For **lexical CandidateSets** used by Name Cards (F.18), **Diversity_P SHALL be computed over head-term families, not over raw strings**. Variants that share the same lexical head (e.g., “Reference plane”, “Plane of reference”, “Planar reference”) **MUST** be treated as one family for coverage and distance; only candidates with distinct heads contribute to lexical Diversity_P. This aligns lexical use of Diversity_P with `FamilyCoverage` / `AliasRisk` and prevents inflating diversity by near-synonyms of a single head.

#### C.17:5.6 - `AttributionIntegrity` — “Did we credit sources and licences correctly?”

* **Intent.** Discourage “novelty theft”; ensure **recombination** is **lawful and transparent**.
* **Carrier.** Outcome + provenance graph.
* **Polarity.** Higher is better.
* **Scale.** **\[0, 1]**; fraction of **required attributions/licence duties** satisfied.
* **Template.** Trace graph coverage against Context policy; licence constraints as **Norm‑CAL** rules.
* **Evidence.** PROV‑style links; licence scans; acknowledgements.
* **Didactic cue.** High `AttributionIntegrity` signals lawful and transparent recombination; low values indicate unacceptable practice in most Contexts.
* **Default role.** `AttributionIntegrity` is **measurable but non‑dominant**. It MAY serve as a **policy filter/tie‑break** (C.19). If certain attribution duties are **must‑constraints**, they belong to **ConstraintFit** (Norm‑CAL) and act as **eligibility gates**. It is **not** part of the default dominance set.
* **Dominance & gating note (normative).** `AttributionIntegrity` is a measurable **Characteristic**; it is **not** in the default dominance set. Contexts MAY use it as a **filter** or **tie‑break** via policy (C.19). Legal/ethical **must‑fit** checks live in **ConstraintFit** (Norm‑CAL); failing those blocks eligibility **before** dominance.

#### C.17:5.7 - `EffortCost` *(advisory)* — “What did it take?”

* **Intent.** Normalise comparisons by cost; not part of “creativity” per se.
* **Carrier.** WorkLedger.
* **Polarity.** Lower is better when used as denominator.
* **Scale.** Resource units (hours, energy, \$).
* **Template.** Sum cost categories over Work that produced the outcome.
* **Evidence.** Time/resource logs; BOM deltas.
* **Didactic cue.** Use **`CreativityPerCost := f(Novelty@context, ValueGain, Surprise)/EffortCost`** for operations planning, not for excellence awards.
