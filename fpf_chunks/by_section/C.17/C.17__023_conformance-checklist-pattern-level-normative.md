### C.17:20 - Conformance Checklist (pattern‑level, normative)

> *Pass these and your CS modelling remains a thinking architecture, not a team‑management manual.*

**CC‑C17‑1 (context‑local CS).**
Every **CreativitySpace** (the characteristic set where ideation and selection are measured) **MUST** be defined *inside one* `U.BoundedContext`; all characteristics and their scales are local to that Context. (Bridges with CL penalties are required across Contexts; see §C.17.16.)

**CC‑C17‑2 (Characteristics, not “characteristics”).**
Each CS dimension **SHALL** be a named **Characteristic** per **MM‑CHR**, with kind (`qualitative`, `ordinal`, `interval`, `ratio`, or `set‑valued`), unit and scale, polarity, and admissible operations. No free‑floating coordinates. (A.CHR‑NORM / A.CSLC‑Kernel.)

**CC‑C17‑3 (Profile ≠ plan).**
A **Profile** is a *state description over characteristics* (what the option *is* in CS); a **Plan** or **Method** is *how you will act*. Never encode choices or schedules into the profile.

**CC‑C17‑4 (Portfolio / retained-set view = set + rule).**
A **Portfolio** or retained-set view is a declared set of candidate profiles **plus** a selection or retention rule (objective + constraints) declared *in the same Context*. It is not a synonym for `Palette`, `Front`, `Archive`, `Shortlist`, or `RankedShortlist`; use the specific set-surface head when that head is recoverable. Presenting only a scatterplot is non‑conformant.

**CC‑C17‑5 (Dominance operator well‑typed).**
A dominance claim **MUST** name the **characteristic subset and polarity** under which it is evaluated. Dominance on incomparable scales (or mixed polarities without explicit transformation) is invalid.

**CC‑C17‑6 (Frontier from rule, not from taste).**
A **Frontier** (Pareto or constraint‑bound) **SHALL** be computed from the declared selection rule; drawing a “nice hull” by eye fails conformance.

**CC‑C17‑7 (Search–Exploit as **dynamics**, not policy dogma).**
Exploration/exploitation **MUST** be expressed as a **dynamics on the declared retained-set measure(s)** (e.g., exploration share as a function of marginal value of information), *not* as a prescriptive budget recipe. Objective, constraint, and decision-policy statements belong to Decsn‑CAL / C.19; C.17 may cite them, but does not own or restate them.

**CC‑C17‑8 (Evidence Graph Referring for scores).**
Any numeric score in a profile **MUST** cite its **MeasurementTemplate** (MM‑CHR) and the **observation/evaluation** that yielded it. No anonymous numbers.

**CC‑C17‑9 (Separable uncertainty lanes).**
Keep **aleatory** vs **epistemic** uncertainty separate on characteristics; their combination rule **MUST** be stated (e.g., interval arithmetic, conservative bound).

**CC‑C17‑10 (Time is explicit).**
Comparisons across iterations **MUST** state `TimeWindow` (snapshot window) and whether *drift* or *refit* occurred (§C.17.14). “Latest” is not a time selector.

**CC‑C17‑11 (No proxy collapse).**
If a composite “creativity index” is used, its **aggregation algebra** (weights, monotone transforms) **MUST** be declared; the primitive characteristics remain queryable.

**CC‑C17‑12 (Work stays on Work).**
Resource/time actuals and run logs live on `U.Work`; CS never carries actuals. We reason **about** profiles / retained sets; we do not audit operations here.
