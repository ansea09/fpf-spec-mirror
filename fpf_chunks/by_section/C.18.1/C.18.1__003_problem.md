### C.18.1:2 - Problem

Omitting **Scale Variables** and the comparison window causes: (i) **unfair parity** (compute/data/FoA mismatched), (ii) **illumination/coverage report-metric  creep** into dominance by default, (iii) late detection of knees and budget waste. **G.9** already forbids scalarising mixed scales and mandates equal **FreshnessWindows**/**pinned editions**; SLL complements this with **ScaleWindow** & elasticity.
