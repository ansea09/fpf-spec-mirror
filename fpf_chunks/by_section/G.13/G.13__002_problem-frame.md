### G.13:1 - Problem frame

FPF already supports lawful characterization, evidence wiring, selector‑side set returns, parity, shipping, dashboards, and refresh. What remains frictionful in practice is **interoperability with external scholarly indexes and discipline repositories** (concept registries, paper/claim graphs, dataset registries, taxonomy stores, “science‑of‑science” indicator feeds), which teams routinely use as *inputs* when authoring a SoTA discipline pack.

Without an explicit **conceptual interop kit**, authors tend to build one‑off pipelines whose “implied semantics” leak into the framework: edition drift becomes invisible, cross‑plane/context reuse becomes implicit, and external signals quietly start acting like a shadow governing spec ref.

`G.13` provides the missing kit: **conceptual registration, alignment, and telemetry hooks** that let external sources be wired into the Part‑G pipeline (**G.2 → G.5 → G.9 → G.10 → G.11**, and optionally **G.12**) while preserving Part‑G invariants via `G.Core`.
