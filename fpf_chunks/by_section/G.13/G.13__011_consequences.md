### G.13:10 - Consequences

* **Interop becomes refresh‑ready.** External source drift produces typed RSCR causes with scopes/payload pins; refresh becomes slice‑scoped rather than global guesswork.
* **Generation‑first authoring becomes cheaper.** External sources become controlled inputs into SoTA synthesis and declared set-result exploration, not ad‑hoc audit decoration.
* **Conceptual hygiene improves.** Explicit cards + edition pins reduce semantic leakage from tools/formats/providers.
* **Cross‑tradition reuse becomes auditable.** Plane/context reuse is surfaced as crossings rather than embedded assumptions.
