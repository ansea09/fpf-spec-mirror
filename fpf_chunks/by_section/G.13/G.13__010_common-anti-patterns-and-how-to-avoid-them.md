### G.13:9 - Common Anti‑Patterns and How to Avoid Them

* **Anti‑pattern: “Format == spec”.** Treating an export schema (KG dump, JSON, RO‑Crate, etc.) as the normative definition.
  **Remedy:** Keep `ExternalIndexCard` / `ClaimMapperCard` / `InteropSurface` as the conceptual specification; treat serialisation as an appendix/tooling concern.

* **Anti‑pattern: Hidden scale invention.** An embedding similarity becomes a “score” without explicit typing/binding.
  **Remedy:** Require `ScaleEmbeddingSpecRef` + edition pins and bind any derived features through CHR/CAL governing definitions.

* **Anti‑pattern: Implicit plane/context reuse.** Using an external concept mapping without its actual relation and receiving-use grounds.
  **Remedy:** Establish the actual sense, kind or plane relation under its governing rule and retain the receiving-use grounds. Publish the bundle or gate anchors required by any actual E.18/A.21 use.

* **Anti‑pattern: Edition‑free dashboards.** Feeding externally derived rows into dashboards without pinned editions/policies.
  **Remedy:** Pin `ExternalIndexRef.edition` and `ClaimMapperRef.edition`; emit RSCR triggers on changes.

* **Anti‑pattern: Interop asserts defaults.** “Interop decides dominance regime / `PortfolioMode`.”
  **Remedy:** Treat defaults as citations only (the relevant governing definition is cited through `G.Core.DefaultGoverningDefinitionIndex`).
