### A.18:6 - Bias-Annotation

The CSLC-Kernel pattern is designed to be **maximally inclusive of different measurement types** while imposing just enough structure to ensure consistency. It does not privilege any particular domain or modality of measurement: a subjective 5-star rating is treated with the same formal rigor as a physical length in meters. In terms of the FPF principle lenses, this pattern consciously balances the **Architectural/Ontological** needs (clear structure for data) with the **Pragmatic/Didactic** needs (flexibility and clarity for users). There is little risk of cross-domain bias here because the pattern explicitly supports both extremes (ordinal and ratio, qualitative and quantitative). By remaining **method-agnostic**, it avoids bias toward certain validation techniques – e.g. it doesn’t assume every measurement comes from an instrument (it could come from expert judgment just as well). One might argue the pattern enforces a somewhat formal approach to what could be informal measures (forcing definition of scale and characteristic), but this formalism is lightweight and is precisely what makes the metric interpretable. In summary, A.18 embodies **neutrality**: it’s a container that fits any content as long as that content is well-labeled. It reinforces **P‑2 (Didactic Primacy)** by making all metrics self-explanatory in terms of what and how, and respects **P‑1 (Cognitive Elegance)** by using a minimal, uniform scheme. No cultural or disciplinary assumptions are baked in – an anthropologist’s “Cultural Significance” scale can live alongside an engineer’s “Voltage” scale with equal status. The pattern’s requirement for declaring polarity (“higher is better” vs “lower is better” vs target range) further avoids bias in interpretation – it prevents the assumption that “more is always better,” which might be untrue in many contexts (e.g. for error rates, lower is better). All these considerations ensure that A.18 introduces no hidden skew; it merely provides a fair playing field for all metrics.
