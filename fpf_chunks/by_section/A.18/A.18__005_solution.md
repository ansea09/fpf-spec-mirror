### A.18:4 - Solution

**Adopt a minimal “one characteristic – one scale – one coordinate (value)” Standard for all measurements.** In the FPF kernel, any metric must bind **exactly one Characteristic to exactly one Scale**, and any observation produces **one Coordinate (value)** on that Scale (with an optional **Level** name if the scale has discrete tiers). We nickname this the **CSLC clause**:

> **Exactly one Characteristic + exactly one Scale ⇒ one Coordinate (value), with an optional Level.**

Concretely, the parts of this clause are defined as follows:

-   **Characteristic:** the aspect or feature being measured (the “CG‑frame” along which comparison is made). It answers “_What are we measuring?_” – e.g. _Distance, Temperature, Quality, Reliability_.

-   **Scale:** the organized set of possible values that the Characteristic can take, including the type of scale (_ordinal_, _interval_, or _ratio_), the measurement **Unit** (if applicable), and any bounds or structure. The Scale defines “_How do we measure it?_” – e.g. “meters on a linear scale from 0 up to 1000” or “ratings 1 through 5 with ordering only”.

-   **Coordinate:** a concrete measured value that locates the subject on the chosen scale. This could be a number (for a numeric scale) or a category label (for an ordinal scale). It answers “_What is the result?_” – e.g. 7.4 (meters), or _Expert_ (level).

-   **Level (optional):** a named **tier or category** on the scale, used only if the scale is tiered or discretized. For example, an ordinal scale might have Levels _Low, Medium, High_. A Level is essentially a human-friendly label for certain coordinates or ranges. On purely continuous scales, **Level** is not used.


Using this **CSLC structure**, every measurement is unambiguous and self-contained: the Characteristic tells us the context, the Scale tells us how to interpret the value, and the Coordinate is the outcome on that scale (with a Level label if appropriate). Notably, this pattern _forbids bundling multiple characteristics into one metric_ – each metric template is one-characteristic-per-template to keep semantics crisp. If something needs to assess multiple factors, it should be modeled as multiple CSLC metrics or an explicit composite over several CSLC metrics (see §8 below). This one-aspect-one-scale rule is what allows unambiguous comparison and prevents hidden complexity.

Finally, the solution ensures **tier optionality**: If a domain uses named Levels, we include them; if not, we don’t force it. For example, one can have a _Bug Severity_ Characteristic with Levels {Minor, Major, Critical} on an ordinal scale, whereas a _Length_ Characteristic would have a continuous scale (no predefined levels, just units). Both fit the pattern.

#### A.18:4.1 - Characteristic-space support must stay declared

- When one front, archive, shortlist, or derived tradition view is discussed in one space, declare the object kind and the relevant characteristic space explicitly.
- Use one `SpaceRef` only when the text truly needs to recover which space or typed feature family is carrying the comparison.
- One declared space does not imply that every neighboring line must use the same space.
- Different declared spaces may coexist for the same family when they answer different comparison questions, but the active one must stay recoverable.
- If one atlas-like reading uses several declared spaces over the same palette, front, archive, or shortlist family, say which `SpaceRef` is active in the current reading rather than letting the atlas label hide that choice.
- If one outcome-side declared space/ref is materially different from one representation-side or search-side declared space/ref, keep that difference explicit rather than calling both simply `space`.
- `OutcomeMapRef` is warranted only when the text needs one declared map from the current set result into one outcome-side or effect-side declared space/ref.
- When `OutcomeMapRef` is cited for one atlas-like or cross-scale reading, keep the source set result and the projected outcome-side declared space/ref visible together so the map stays support for the view rather than a replacement default.
