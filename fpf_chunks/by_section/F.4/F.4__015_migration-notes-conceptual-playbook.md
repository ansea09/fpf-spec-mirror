### F.4:13 - Migration notes (conceptual playbook)

1. **Context update (edition split).** If the Context’s Local‑Sense changes, **fork** the card per new SenseCell; keep the old card as historically valid.
2. **Family correction (Role and Status).** If a card mixes behaviour and deontics, **split** into one Role and one Status; move permission language to the Status.
3. **Tighten by refinement.** When practice reveals a stricter understanding, prefer **T′ ⪯ T** over replacing **T**; this preserves existing assignments conceptually.
4. **Rename safely (labels only).** If F.5 revises labels, change **Tech/Plain** wording; **SenseCell** and **invariants** remain untouched.
5. **Scope correction.** If Holder scope was too wide, split into **parallel cards** with disjoint Holder scopes; avoid complex conditional invariants.
6. **Bridge discovery.** Do **not** inject Cross‑context text into cards; record the relation as an **F.9 Bridge** (with CL policy), leaving the cards as they are.
