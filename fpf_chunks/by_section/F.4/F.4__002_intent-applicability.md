### F.4:1 - Intent & applicability

**Intent.** Provide a **conceptual template** for two kinds of assignables:

* **Role Template** — a **behavioural mask** that a holder can wear **in a specific Context** (U.BoundedContext), shaping how it **acts** (via Method/Execution relations).
* **Status Template** — an **epistemic or deontic badge** that a holder (or artefact, event, claim) can **bear** inside a Context, shaping how it is **treated** (evaluation, permission, standing).

Each template is **grounded in a SenseCell** `⟨Context, Local‑Sense⟩` from F.3 and declares **minimal invariants** that later **assignments** must satisfy. No Cross‑context meaning is imported here.

**Applicability.** Whenever you need to **speak precisely** about what it means to be *a Participant (BPMN)*, *hold an access‑role (RBAC)*, *be an Incident (ITIL)*, or *carry a Verified status (evidence line)*, before minting U.Types or drawing Cross‑context bridges.

**Non‑goals.** No workflows, no storage, no editors. No equations for assurance or control; those live in Part B/C. This pattern describes **how to think and speak** about assignables — not how to manage files.
