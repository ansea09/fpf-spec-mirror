### B.3.5:12 - Consequences (benefits, trade‑offs, mitigations)

**Benefits**

* **Cognitive clarity for authors and readers.** By making Working‑Model relations canonical and keeping formal bases as optional groundings, CT2R reduces the barrier to disciplined reasoning while preserving a path to higher assurance when necessary.  This honours the B.3 family's “few characteristics, conservative aggregation” ethos and keeps order/time outside of structure.
* **Progressive assurance without tooling commitments.** The *postulate → inferential → axiomatic* assurance-posture progression lets teams raise assurance deliberately, matching their context and risk, in line with B.3.3’s maturity logic.
* **Explicit fit management.** Treating edge‑fit (CL) as a first‑class concern prevents silent over‑confidence: weak mappings visibly cap reliability of composed claims.
* **Cleaner separation of concerns.** Distinguishing collections from compositions and keeping sequence/time in Γ\_method and Γ\_time prevents recurrent category errors and preserves Γ‑algebra reviewability.

**Trade‑offs & mitigations**

* **Extra prose discipline.** Declaring `validationMode` and writing a short grounding narrative (when *axiomatic*) adds authoring effort. *Mitigation:* reuse local templates; keep narratives concise and Γ\_m‑oriented by idea rather than notation.
* **Temptation to stay “forever postulate.”** Teams may stop at Working‑Model relations. *Mitigation:* use B.3.3’s subtypes/levels as a **planning aid** to decide where *axiomatic* or *inferential* grounding is worth the cost.
* **Perceived conservatism.** Acknowledging weak fit (CL) may lower effective reliability of otherwise strong parts. *Mitigation:* treat CL as a guide to improvement (reconcile terms, align units, verify interfaces) rather than a punishment.

> **One‑line takeaway for managers.**
> CT2R lets you **talk in natural, domain‑meaningful relations** while preserving a clear, optional path to formal grounding and empirical checking—so confidence can grow deliberately without dragging your model into tooling or syntax.
