### B.3.5:1 - Intent

*Provide a single, human-facing family of **Working-Model** relations as the **publication surface**, with explicit hooks for (G) grounding and (R) reliability, without exposing constructor jargon or overloading day-to-day authors.*

**What you get (manager/engineer view).**
 The same relations you already know (e.g., **ComponentOf**) remain the **public interface**.

**What changes (auditor/ontologist view).**
* Each published edge carries two additional commitments:

  1. **`tv:groundedBy`** → points to a **reconstructible trace** (e.g., `Γ_m.sum`) whenever the edge is *structural*.
  2. **`validationMode ∈ {axiomatic, inferential, postulate}`** → declares how the author justifies the assertion.

This is the **alias‑plus‑grounding** split: **Compose‑CAL** builds the trace; **CT2R‑LOG** declares the alias pattern and links it; **Lang‑CHR** supplies the labels.
