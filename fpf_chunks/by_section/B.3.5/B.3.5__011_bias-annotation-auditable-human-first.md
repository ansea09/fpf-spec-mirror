### B.3.5:10 - Bias‑Annotation (auditable, human‑first)

The purpose of this section is to make **typical cognitive slips** visible and name the **counter‑moves** an author (or reviewer) should apply **in thought**—not with tools. These biases are generic; the remedies point to earlier FPF guard‑rails and neighbouring patterns.

| Bias (name)                     | Symptom in the model                                                                                                          | Cognitive counter‑move (conceptual only)                                                                                                                                                                          | Where to check                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Formalism capture**           | Treating a constructive trace as “the real thing” and the human relation (e.g., *ComponentOf*) as an optional label.          | Re‑assert **canonical‑first**: the Working‑Model relation is the canonical publication. A constructive trace is a **grounding** you may attach when assurance demands it. Choose a **validationMode** explicitly. | CC‑CT2R‑1, CC‑CT2R‑2; B.3 skeleton for assurance conservatism.       |
| **Canonical inversion**         | Demanding a constructive grounding for **epistemic** claims by default. *(For **structural** claims, Constructive grounding is mandatory; epistemic remains progressive.)*                    | Keep **progressive assurance**: declare `validationMode ∈ {postulate, inferential, axiomatic}`; reserve *axiomatic* with **Constructive** grounding for structural; use **Logical/Mapping**/**Empirical** where appropriate. Express formality via **F** (C.2.3), not tiers. | CC-CT2R-2; B.3.3 relation-kind discipline & validation modes.         |
| **Order/time leakage**          | Encoding sequence or phase as part‑whole edges.                                                                               | Apply **Strict Distinction**: order/time belong to Γ\_method and Γ\_time, not to mereology or CT2R relations.                                                                                                       | B.3 “keep order/time in their own lanes”; cross‑ref Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time.  |
| **Notation lock‑in**            | Letting a diagram or syntax define the meaning (“it’s true because the diagram says so”).                                     | Enforce **Notational Independence**: meaning is defined in prose/maths; renderings are illustrative only.                                                                                                         | Part E guard‑rail on notational independence.                        |
| **Congruence blindness**        | Composing strong parts through weak mappings without acknowledging the fit penalty.                                           | Make **edge‑fit first‑class**: reason about Congruence Level (CL) on connections; penalise low fit conceptually.                                                                                                  | B.3 universal aggregation skeleton (Φ(CL)); anti‑patterns list.      |
| **Collection/composition swap** | Using **MemberOf** to stand in for **PartOf** (or vice versa), then carrying over reliability as if it were a structural sum. | Re‑separate **MemberOf** (collections) from **part‑whole** mereology; read A.14 notes in Γ\_epist context.                                                                                                        | Γ\_epist context / A.14 compliance.                                  |
| **DesignRunTag chimera**          | Mixing design‑time and run‑time evidence into one “assurance” line.                                                           | Split the **scope** of the claim: `S ∈ {design, run}`; compare side‑by‑side rather than merging.                                                                                                                  | B.3 typed claim tuple & anti‑pattern “DesignRunTag chimera”.           |

> **Reviewer reminder.** Bias audit is a **reading aid**. It never licenses tooling talk in Core; use the guard‑rails in Part E to keep semantics primacy and unidirectional dependence of layers.
