### A.3:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A3‑0 - U.RoleAssgnment presence.**
Every claim that a holon “performs a transformation” MUST be backed by at least one **RoleAssignment** triple:
`U.RoleAssignment(holder: U.Holon, role: U.Role=TransformerRole, context: U.BoundedContext, timespan?)`.
This is the canonical way to say *who acts, in which role, where (semantically), and when*. See **A.2.1** for the universal **`U.RoleAssignment`** Standard and its invariants.

**CC‑A3‑1 - External transformer discipline.**
The **bearer** of `TransformerRole` MUST NOT be the same model instance as the **object‑under‑change** within the same assignment. Self-modification is modelled via two **`U.RoleAssignment`s** (same holder playing two roles) or via an explicit controller–plant split. This upholds **Agent Externalization** (A.12).

**CC‑A3‑2 - Design–Run separation.**
`U.MethodDescription` (recipe, definition) is a design-time `U.Episteme`; `U.Method` (mask-of-work) and `U.Work` (executed work) are run-time kinds. It is non-conformant to mutate a `MethodDescription` inside a `Work` log or to treat a `Work` as a `MethodDescription`. This enforces the kernel’s **Temporal Duality** (A.4) and the A.15 alignment.

**CC‑A3‑3 - Boundary‑crossing evidence.**
A conformant transformation that changes a system’s state MUST reference the **boundary effects** it induces: interactions, flows, or state transitions attach to the target system’s boundary (per Γ‑defaults for additive, min/AND/OR folds). Conservation‑class effects MUST satisfy B‑invariants (e.g., **B‑1 Conservation**).

**CC‑A3‑4 - Method ←→ Work traceability.**
Every `U.Work` MUST (i) name the `U.Method` it instantiates and (ii) trace the `U.MethodDescription` it claims to follow (versioned). If a deviation occurs, it MUST be logged as a **policy override** or **exception path**; silent drift is non‑conformant. (A.15 guards the vocabulary; Γ\_work aggregates resource deltas.)

**CC‑A3‑5 - Episteme as object‑under‑change.**
When the changed holon is an **episteme** (document, dataset, theory), the transformer is still a **system**; the episteme’s history MUST be recorded via **PhaseOf** (versioning) and **ConstituentOf/PortionOf** as appropriate (not via component trees). See A.14’s mereology firewalls and Γ\_epist hooks.

**CC‑A3‑6 - Units and measures for resource effects.**
Any resource consumption/production in `U.Work` MUST specify the **measure μ** and **units** (e.g., kg, J, bytes); “percentage” effects MUST be grounded in a PortionOf μ to be Γ‑aggregatable. (A.14 POR‑axioms; Γ\_work usage.)

**CC‑A3‑7 - Provenance minimum.**
For each `U.RoleAssignment` and `U.Work`, the following fields are REQUIRED: `{authority?, justification?, provenance?}` where `justification: U.Episteme` and `provenance: U.Method`/process evidence. This aligns with the kernel’s governance and B‑cluster lineage practices.

**CC‑A3‑8 - Policy–Plan–Action separation for agentic cases.**
If the transformer bearer is agentic, the log MUST separate `D.Policy → U.PlannedAction → U.Action` (A.15/A.13), preserving where failure occurred (strategy, plan, or execution).

**CC‑A3‑9 - Context‑local conflicts.**
Conflicts among roles (including `TransformerRole`) are only **within the same bounded context**; cross‑context differences are admissible if bridges are declared. Non‑conformance arises only when a context’s own incompatibility rules are violated. (A.2.1 `U.RoleAssignment` invariants.)

**CC‑A3‑10 - Γ‑compatibility.**
Descriptions MUST be sufficient for the relevant Γ‑aggregations to run: Γ\_method for recipe composition, Γ\_work for resource deltas, Γ\_sys for boundary integration, Γ\_time for ordering. Each Γ flavour declares its A.14 hooks (Portion/Phase) and inherits B‑invariants.
