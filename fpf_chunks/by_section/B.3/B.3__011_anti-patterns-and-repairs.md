### B.3:8 - Anti‑patterns and repairs


| Anti‑pattern             | Symptom                                                    | Repair                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Averaging assurance**  | Mean of `R_i` reported as system reliability               | Use `min R_i` on the cutset, then apply `Φ(CL_min)`.                                                           |
| **Ordinal arithmetic**   | Averaging `F` or `CL` to produce “2.3”                     | Use `min`/`max` or thresholds; never average ordinals.                                                         |
| **Coverage as centroid** | Replacing `G` union with a single “typical point”          | Keep `G` as set/coverage; if a numeric proxy is needed, derive it from the set.                                |
| **Ignoring congruence**  | No penalty for low-CL mappings or interfaces                    | Assign `CL` to integration edges and apply `Φ(CL_min)`.                                                           |
| **DesignRunTag chimera**   | “One score” mixing blueprint and telemetry                 | Split into `S=design` and `S=run` tuples; compare explicitly.                                                  |
| **Agency override**      | Claiming higher assurance because a controller is “clever” | Agency may justify *how* improvements are achieved; it cannot remove WLNK or `Φ`.                              |
| **MemberOf as stock**    | Using `MemberOf` to sum reliabilities                      | Keep `MemberOf` for collections; reliability comes from the relevant **Γ** composition (e.g., Γ\_sys cutset). |
| **Assurance-claim laundering** | Badge, dashboard color, credential display, compliance mark, provenance label, model card, datasheet, data card, assurance document, attestation label, or generated confidence phrase is used as an assurance claim. | Keep it as orientation or source pointer unless a typed assurance claim and `A.10` evidence path support the intended assurance use. |
