### C.3.A:10 - Rationale (why an Annex) (informative)

* **Focus.** Keeps **guard mechanics** together, easing adoption in ESG/Method templates.
* **Separation.** Prevents leakage of AT/typed flavor into “Scope math”.
* **Auditability.** Standard shapes let reviewers check determinism, bridges, penalties, and freshness quickly.
* **Inter‑pattern glue.** Hooks **USM**, **Kind‑CAL**, **Bridges**, and **F–G–R** without inventing new scales.

#### C.3.A:Annex A - How typed reasoning plugs into **Compliance & Regulatory Alignment**  \[A/I]

> **For managers.** This section shows how to make **regulatory adoption and reuse** precise, auditable, and portable using **Kinds**, **KindBridges** (with a kind‑bridge congruence level, noted as **CL^k** for editors), and **USM Scope**. It cleanly separates *what the law is about* from *where and when it applies*, and routes any cross‑jurisdiction uncertainty to **R** (assurance). It never changes **F** (form) or **G** (scope) to hide mismatches.

##### C.3.A:A.1 Purpose & fit

**What this solves.** Regulations and standards name classes of things (“**Adult person**,” “**Class II medical device**,” “**Personal data**,” “**Lease**”). In one context they are native; in another they are foreign. Without typed reasoning, teams either (a) hand‑translate terms (silently changing meaning), or (b) reduce everything to Context labels (“domain = EU”), which cannot be checked by guards.

**What we add.**

1. Model regulatory categories as **Kinds** (with `KindSignature` and `⊑`),
2. map them across Contexts with **KindBridges** and **type‑congruence `CL^k`**,
3. express **Claim scope (G)** over **Context slices** that explicitly list *jurisdiction, version, and a time selector (Γ_time)*, and
4. apply **R‑penalties** (`Ψ(CL^k)`and, if scope is bridged,`Φ(CL)`) while **keeping F and G unchanged**.

##### C.3.A:A.2 Normative obligations

**Conformance.** A model or authoring action conforms to A.2 iff it satisfies **C‑REG‑1..C‑REG‑8** below.

**C‑REG‑1 (Regulatory kinds).** Regulatory categories **SHALL** be represented as `U.Kind` in the authority’s Context (e.g., `AdultPerson@RegY`, `MedicalDeviceClassII@FDA`, `PersonalData@GDPR`, `Lease@IFRS`). Each such kind **SHALL** have a `KindSignature` with a declared **F** level (C.3.2).

**C‑REG‑2 (KindBridge).** Cross‑context reuse of a regulatory category **MUST** declare a **KindBridge** with a kind‑bridge congruence level (**CL^k**) and **loss notes** (C.3.3). The mapping **SHALL** preserve the “is‑a / subkind‑of” direction and **MUST NOT** invert it.

**C‑REG‑3 (Scope is USM).** Regulatory **applicability** (jurisdiction, effective dates, product families, platforms) **SHALL** be expressed as **Claim scope (G)** over `U.ContextSlice`, with an explicit **time selector (Γ_time)**. Applicability **MUST NOT** be encoded into kinds.

**C‑REG‑4 (No synonym shortcuts).** Editors **MUST NOT** treat legal terms as synonyms of local kinds without a KindBridge. Any term alignment **SHALL** be documented (mapping + `CL^k` + loss notes).

**C‑REG‑5 (Determinism).** `MemberOf(e, k_reg, slice)` **MUST** be deterministically evaluable when used in guards (no “latest law” or unstated grace periods).

**C‑REG‑6 (Penalties land in R).** When a claim or guard relies on Cross‑context classification (membership decided via a KindBridge), the receiving Context **MUST** apply the **kind‑bridge penalty** (based on **CL^k**) to **R**; if the **Scope** is also bridged, apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** (based on **CL**) to **R** as well. **Invariant:** penalty routing changes **R** only; **F** and **G** remain unchanged.

**C‑REG‑7 (Editioning).** Changes in law/regulator guidance that alter membership or applicability **SHALL** be recorded as content changes: update `KindSignature` (kinds) and/or update **Claim scope** (ΔG±). Guards **MUST** name a time selector (Γ_time) and **MUST NOT** rely on an implicit “latest” time.

**C‑REG‑8 (Masks, not clones).** Local process nuances (e.g., clinic‑specific cohort definitions) **SHALL** be captured with **RoleMasks** over the adopted kind; editors **MUST NOT** clone a new kind unless a stable **subkind** is warranted.

##### C.3.A:A.3 Guard macros (ready to use)

**(a) `Guard_RegAdopt` — adopt a regulatory requirement into a Context (Plain: check scope, map the legal category, and account for penalties)**

Use when an internal policy is defined by reference to an authority’s category.

```
Inputs: Claim P (policy), RegKind k_reg in Context R_auth, TargetSlice S_local
Guard_RegAdopt(P, k_reg, S_local):
  1. ScopeCoverage:       U.ClaimScope(P) covers S_local                 // USM
  2. Γ_time:              S_local specifies Γ_time (no "latest")         // USM
  3. KindBridge:          a KindBridge exists that maps the legal category to a local kind, with **CL^k** at least the minimum policy level
  4. MemberOfDefined:     MemberOf(?, k_local, S_local) is defined       // determinism
  5. Penalties→R:         apply the **kind‑bridge penalty** (based on CL^k) to **R**
  6. ScopeBridge?         if the policy’s scope lives in the authority’s Context, translate it via a Scope Bridge; apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** (based on CL) to **R**
  7. EvidenceFreshness:   freshness windows for any bound evidence hold  // C.2.2
```

**(b) `Guard_RegChange` — react to a regulatory change (Plain: re‑issue the kind and/or scope and refresh penalties)**

```
Inputs: Reg change Δ (new edition, guidance), impacted kinds/claims
Guard_RegChange(Δ):
  1. Identify impact:      does Δ alter KindSignature (membership) or Scope predicates?
  2. If KindSignature:     version k_reg; update KindBridge; re-evaluate CL^k; update loss notes
  3. If Scope:             publish ΔG± (widen/narrow) to Claim scope; update guards
  4. Reassess penalties:   recompute Ψ(CL^k), Φ(CL) → R
  5. Γ_time discipline:    set sunrise/sunset; forbid implicit retroactivity in guards
```

**(c) `Guard_RegXContextUse` — cross‑jurisdiction use with both bridges (Plain: move scope and kind, then account for both penalties)**

```
Guard_RegXContextUse(P, k_reg@R_auth, S_local@R_local):
  1. Scope bridge:      a Scope Bridge from the authority Context to the local context exists with CL at least the policy minimum; the translated scope covers the local slice
  2. Kind bridge:       a KindBridge maps the legal category to a local kind with **CL^k** at least the policy minimum
  3. MemberOfDefined:   MemberOf(?, k_local, S_local) is defined
  4. Penalties→R:       apply the **scope‑bridge** and **kind‑bridge** penalties to **R**
  5. Loss-guided narrow: optionally narrow Scope' where known losses are material (best practice)
```

##### C.3.A:A.4 Worked examples  \[I]

**(1) Healthcare — “Adult” dosage rule across jurisdictions**

*Reg source.* Jurisdiction Y defines `AdultPerson@RegY` (AT around K2, F4) with **age at least 18**; your hospital Context uses `AdultPatient` (**age at least 21**).
*Claim.* “For all `x ∈ AdultPatient`: dosage ≤ D/kg for drug M.”
*Adoption.*

* **KindBridge.** Map `AdultPerson@RegY → AdultPatient`; **`CL^k = 1`**; **loss note:** boundary mismatch (18↔21).
* **Scope.** `{jurisdiction=Y, formulary=M, time selector (Γ_time)=from 2026‑01‑01}`.
* **Guard.** `Guard_RegAdopt` passes; **R** penalized by `Ψ(1)`. Policy narrows Scope to mapped cohort (age≥21) for in‑house use.
* **Change.** If Y changes adult to ≥19 (new edition), run `Guard_RegChange`: version the kind, refresh the bridge, re‑assess `CL^k`, update guards.

**(2) Privacy — GDPR↔CCPA PII across Contexts**

*Reg kinds.* `PersonalData@GDPR`, `PersonalInformation@CCPA`.
*Internal kind.* `PersonalData@Product` with masks per data store.
*Policy claim.* “No sharing of `SensitiveAttribute` outside processors.”
*Adoption.*

* **KindBridges.** `SensitiveAttribute@GDPR → SensitiveAttribute@Product` (**`CL^k=2`**); `SensitivePersonalInformation@CCPA → SensitiveAttribute@Product` (**`CL^k=1`**, loss: biometric nuance).
* **Scope.** Two policies with **SpanUnion** over `{jurisdiction=EU}` and `{jurisdiction=CA}`, each with its own **Γ\_time** windows and evidence freshness.
* **Guards.** For CA, apply stronger **R** penalty (`Ψ(1)`), and narrow to the mapped subset (exclude ambiguous fields).
* **Do not.** Do not rename GDPR terms to local labels **without a KindBridge**.

**(3) Export control — US EAR “600‑series” classification**

*Reg kind.* `EAR600SeriesItem@US` (AT≈K2, F3→F4 as predicates are formalized).
*Local kind.* `Product@Company`.
*Work scope.* `{destination=countries, end_use, time selector (Γ_time)=shipment date}` for the shipping capability.
*Adoption.*

* **KindBridge.** Map `EAR600SeriesItem@US → Product@Company`; `CL^k=2` (loss: component kit edge cases); loss notes recorded.
* **Capability guard (Method–Work).**

  * `U.WorkScope(Ship)` covers `JobSlice` (destination, end use, time).
  * `MemberOf(product, EAR600_mapped, JobSlice)` defined (classification present).
  * Apply `Ψ(2)` to **R** (classification uncertainty) and, if reusing US scope text, `Φ(CL_scope)` too.
* **Outcome.** Shipment admitted only for allowed destinations; higher **R** may require manual review.

**(4) Finance — IFRS vs US GAAP “Lease”**

*Reg kinds.* `Lease@IFRS`, `Lease@USGAAP`.
*Local kind.* `LeaseStandard@Corp` used in policy “recognize lease liabilities.”
*Adoption.*
* **KindBridge.** `Lease@IFRS → LeaseStandard@Corp` (**`CL^k=2`**; loss: short‑term exceptions differ).
* **Scope.** `{jurisdiction=IFRS, Γ_time=financial period, ledger=v7}`.
* **Evidence.** LA plans cover subkinds (operating vs finance) per your classification; the kind‑bridge congruence level (CL^k) drives extra testing near boundary cases.

##### C.3.A:A.5 Design guidance & pitfalls  \[I]

**Do this.**

* **Treat regulatory categories as Kinds.** Put the *definition* into `KindSignature` (aim for **F4** predicates where practical).
* **Make time explicit.** In guards, require a **time selector (Γ_time)** for effective dates and grace periods. Forbid “latest”.
* **Publish bridges with loss notes.** If two jurisdictions’ categories are “almost the same,” say *how*, rate **`CL^k`**, and note what is lost.
* **Split “where” from “what.”** Keep **Scope (G)** over `U.ContextSlice` (jurisdiction, plant, Standard versions) separate from **MemberOf** on the kind.
* **Route uncertainty to R.** Use `Ψ(CL^k)` and `Φ(CL)`; never modify **F/G** to hide ambiguity.

**Avoid this.**

* **Synonym games.** Don’t alias “Adult” to local `AdultPatient` in prose. Use a **KindBridge**.
* **Scope by labels.** “Domain = EU” is not a guard. Use explicit `U.ContextSlice` fields (jurisdiction, version, time selector) and **Scope** predicates.
* **Hiding time.** Never rely on “current law”; always fix **Γ\_time** (point/window/policy).
* **Widening G to compensate for type gaps.** If kinds don’t line up, introduce a **subkind**, add a **mask/adapter**, or **narrow**; don’t “make the scope bigger”.

##### C.3.A:A.6 Migration checklist  \[I]

1. **Inventory** regulatory references in policies/specs.
2. **Create Kind cards** for referenced legal categories (intent summary, `KindSignature` + **F**, known subkinds, AT tag if helpful).
3. **Publish KindBridges** to your local kinds with `CL^k` and loss notes.
4. **Rewrite guards** to use **Scope coverage** (USM) plus `MemberOf` on the mapped kind; add an explicit **time selector (Γ_time)**.
5. **Wire penalties**: `Ψ(CL^k)` and `Φ(CL)` lower **R**; refresh evidence windows.
6. **Catalog RoleMasks** for local nuances; promote frequently reused masks to **subkinds**.

##### C.3.A:A.7 Manager’s one‑page pattern  \[I]

* **Question 1 — Where does the rule apply?** → **Scope (G)** over **Context slices** (jurisdiction, plant, Standard, and a **time selector (Γ_time)**).
* **Question 2 — About what things?** → **Kind** (regulatory category) with a **KindBridge** if foreign.
* **Gate recipe.** **Scope covers the TargetSlice** and **membership for the mapped kind is defined**, and **both bridges are present where needed**; then **apply bridge penalties to R** and decide.
* **Change handling.** New law edition? Update `KindSignature`/Bridge (kinds) and/or **Scope** (ΔG); never rely on “latest.”
* **Accountability.** Keep **loss notes**, **CL/CL^k**, and **Γ\_time** in the decision record.

#### C.3.A:Annex B - How typed reasoning plugs into **Assurance Lanes (VA/LA/TA) & Evidence design**  \[A/I]

**Intent (manager’s view).** Typed reasoning turns “prove/test/qualify” into a **repeatable plan**. By making *what the rule talks about* explicit (named **Kinds**, their **subkinds**, and optional **RoleMasks**), you can:

1. design **proof obligations** that actually quantify over the right things (VA),
2. build **test plans** that cover the **right variants/subkinds** in the **right context slices** (LA), and
3. isolate **tool risk** (TA) instead of letting it bleed into scope or type semantics.

**Invariant reminders.**
— **Scope (G)** is *where* a claim holds — expressed over `U.ContextSlice` (with an explicit time selector, **Γ_time**).
— **Kind membership** is *which things* the claim ranges over inside that slice — checked with `MemberOf(… , kind, slice)`.
— **Bridge penalties**: the **scope‑bridge penalty** (based on **CL**) and the **kind‑bridge penalty** (based on **CL^k**) both lower **R** (assurance). They never change **F** (form) or **G** (scope).

##### C.3.A:B.1 What you get with typed assurance  \[I]

* **Targeted proofs (VA).** If a policy says “for every **PassengerCar** …” (notation hint: ∀x:PassengerCar), the VA lane now has a clear target. You can prove obligations **once for the kind** (and its subkinds), instead of re‑proving per ad‑hoc label.
* **Subkind‑aware test plans (LA).** Test matrices are indexed by **subkinds** (and RoleMasks) × **context slices**; coverage stops being accidental.
* **Deterministic guards.** A test/proof either **applies** to the TargetSlice and Kind (`Scope covers & MemberOf defined`) or it doesn’t. No “latest,” no silent widening.
* **Clean tool boundaries (TA).** You qualify the **prover/model‑checker/classifier** once and route **tool confidence** to TA, not to “broadened” claims.

##### C.3.A:B.2 Normative obligations for evidence design

**EA‑1 (Two checks).** Every VA/LA artifact that supports a typed claim **SHALL** bind **both**:

* **Scope predicate**: `U.ClaimScope(Claim) covers TargetSlice` (with explicit `Γ_time`), and
* **Kind predicate**: `MemberOf(?, k, TargetSlice)` is **defined** (deterministic).

**EA‑2 (Subkind coverage).** When a claim quantifies over `k`, target‑contexts **SHALL** justify LA coverage **per relevant subkind** of `k` (or **per RoleMask** if masks stand in for stable subkinds). “Representative set” **MUST** be stated explicitly.

**EA‑3 (Independence for unions).** If a published **SpanUnion** of evidence lines is used to enlarge covered area, **independence** of lines **SHALL** be documented (no shared weakest link).

**EA‑4 (Bridges accounted).** If a VA/LA artifact travels across Contexts:

* **Scope movement** **SHALL** use a Scope Bridge (Part B) with **CL** and apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** to **R**.
* **Kind movement** **SHALL** use a **KindBridge** (§ C.3.3) with **CL^k** and apply the **kind‑bridge penalty** to **R**.
  Neither movement **SHALL** alter **F** or **G**.

  Neither movement **SHALL** alter **F** nor **G**.

**EA‑5 (Freshness).** LA evidence **SHALL** declare freshness windows tied to `Γ_time` (no implicit “latest”). Expiry **MUST** fail guards closed until refreshed.

**EA‑6 (No scope‑by‑wording).** Editors **MUST NOT** widen **G** by rewriting a claim to sound “more general.” Widening **G** (ΔG+) is permitted **only** with new support that truly enlarges the set of slices.

**EA‑7 (TA separation).** Tool qualification (TA) **SHALL** be tracked independently. VA/LA guards **MUST NOT** substitute “tool is trusted” for content proof/coverage.

##### C.3.A:B.3 Designing the **evidence matrix**  \[I]

A practical way to plan LA/VA is a **matrix**:

| Row set                       | Column set                                                   | Cell content                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kinds** (subkinds or masks) | **Context slices** (Standard versions, env ranges, `Γ_time`) | **Evidence unit** (proof fragment, test batch, monitoring window), with **Scope** and **MemberOf** predicates attached |

* **Choose rows.** Start with the kind and list **relevant subkinds** (notation hint: kᵢ is a subkind of k) or stable **RoleMasks**.
* **Choose columns.** Split your declared **Scope (G)** into **named slices** you intend to support (e.g., “dry, speed up to 50” and “wet, speed up to 40” with specific rigs and versioned Standards).
* **Fill cells.** Attach one or more **evidence units** per cell (proof obligations for VA; test campaigns/monitoring windows for LA). Mark **bridged** cells and their **CL/CL^k** penalties to **R**.

> **Tip.** For formal kinds and “up‑to‑iso” kinds (AT K2/K3), expect **more rows** (more variants to cover). For instance‑like kinds (AT K0), expect **fewer rows** and **tighter columns** (narrow slices, stricter freshness).

##### C.3.A:B.4 VA lane — proofs that match the kind  \[A/I]

**What VA contributes.** Proofs reduce ambiguity and eliminate many LA proof requirements when they **truly quantify over the intended kind** and **live in the declared Scope**.

**VA‑patterns (informative):**

* **Proof over the Kind (F7–F8).** “For every **PassengerCar**, the property holds” (notation hint: ∀x:PassengerCar). If the property depends on subkind‑specific rules, split lemmas per subkind.
* **Proof‑carrying components.** When the content is **F8** (dependent types), the build rejects violations; LA can shrink to **conformance smoke** within the slices.
* **Up‑to‑iso (AT K3).** Equational reasoning “up‑to‑iso” is acceptable **only** if the KindSignature works at that level and receivers accept **KindBridge** that preserves equivalences.

**VA‑obligations (normative):**

* **VA‑1.** A proof carrier **SHALL** cite the **Kind** it quantifies over and reference the **Claim scope** slices it assumes.
* **VA‑2.** Cross‑context acceptance of proofs **SHALL** use both bridges (Scope+Kind) and apply **Φ/Ψ** penalties to **R** (never to F/G).
* **VA‑3.** If the proof relies on **tool kernels**, their **TA** status **SHALL** be disclosed; weakening TA **MUST NOT** be “paid for” by silent scope widening.

**Mini‑example (VA).**
Policy P: “∀ x: PassengerCar. stoppingDistance(x) ≤ 50 m on dry at speed≤50.”
— **Kind**: `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle` (K2), signature F4 (predicates).
— **Scope**: `{surface=dry, speed≤50, rig=v3, Γ_time=rolling 180 d}`.
— **Proof**: a proof assistant lemma over `PassengerCar` (tool choice is context‑local).
— **Reuse** to Plant‑B: a Scope Bridge with **CL=2** (rig bias) and a KindBridge with **CL^k=3** (same classification). Apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** for CL=2 and the **kind‑bridge penalty** for CL^k=3 to **R**.

##### C.3.A:B.5 LA lane — tests & monitoring that cover the right variants  \[A/I]

**What LA contributes.** Empirical assurance for claims with executable semantics or physical interfaces; especially when F ≤ F6 or when stochastic/real‑world effects matter.

**LA‑patterns (informative):**

* **Cover by subkind.** Test at least one representative per subkind; add more where variability inside a subkind matters.
* **Boundary probing.** Concentrate tests near **KindSignature** and **Scope** boundaries (e.g., temp limits, speed caps).
* **Hybrid checks (F6).** When software controllers interact with physical systems, ensure **both sides** declare obligations; include their interaction cases in the matrix.
* **Monitoring windows.** For live systems, define **Γ\_time policies** (e.g., rolling 30 d) and tie alerts to **kind‑aware metrics** (“error rate per `ServiceInstance`”).

**LA‑obligations (normative):**

* **LA‑1.** Each test campaign **SHALL** specify **rows/columns** in the evidence matrix and attach **Scope/MemberOf** predicates to each run.
* **LA‑2.** Freshness windows **SHALL** be explicit and enforced in guards (no “latest”).
* **LA‑3.** If a **KindBridge** merges subkinds, test plans **SHALL** be adjusted (more cells, stricter acceptance), and the **kind‑bridge penalty** (based on CL^k) applied to **R**.
* **LA‑4.** Publishing **SpanUnion** coverage requires the independence note (which support lines differ).

**Mini‑example (LA).**
Claim: “For all `x ∈ Vehicle`: brakeDistance ≤ 50 m on dry, ≤ 40 m on wet.”
— **Rows**: `{PassengerCar, LightTruck}`.
— **Columns**: `{dry, ≤50}`, `{wet, ≤40}` with rigs and versions.
— **Cells**: PC/dry covered by track tests; LT/wet by simulation + surrogate tests (independent lines → SpanUnion allowed).
— **Bridge** to jurisdiction Y collapses EV vs ICE ⇒ `CL^k=2`. Apply **Ψ(2)** to **R**; add extra wet tests to compensate.

##### C.3.A:B.6 TA lane — tool qualification where it belongs  \[A/I]

**What TA contributes.** Confidence in **provers, checkers, model‑checkers, data classifiers** and pipelines. TA is about the **machinery**, not the **claim** or **kind** semantics.

**TA‑patterns (informative):**

* **Prover kernels.** Audit/qualification of the kernel version used for VA proofs.
* **Automated Model‑checkers.** Qualification against seeded faults; document limits (precision, nondeterminism).
* **Classifiers used for `MemberOf`.** If membership uses ML or rules engines, qualify the **classifier** separately; any drift monitoring belongs to LA freshness.

**TA‑obligations (normative):**

* **TA‑1.** Tools critical to VA/LA **SHALL** declare their qualification status and version; guards **SHALL** reference these declarations when they matter.
**TA‑2.** Lower tool qualification **MUST NOT** be hidden by relaxing **F** or widening **G**. target‑contexts may offset it by demanding **more evidence** in **R** (for example, extra tests), per policy.

##### C.3.A:B.7 Guard macros for evidence planning & attachment

**Guard\_EvidencePlan\_Typed** — approve a plan that is adequate for a typed claim.
*Plain reading.* The first macro checks that the plan names the rows (kinds or masks) and columns (slices), that scope and membership can be checked for each cell, that any Cross‑context moves declare bridges, and that penalties are budgeted in **R**.

```
1. MatrixDeclared:    Evidence matrix rows = {subkinds or masks of k}; columns = {TargetSlices within ClaimScope}
2. ScopeBound:        For each column, ClaimScope covers that slice with explicit Γ_time
3. KindBound:         MemberOf(?, k, slice) is defined (deterministic) for all planned slices
4. BridgeBudgeted:    If cross-context:
                        (a) Scope Bridge(s) declared with CL → attach the **scope‑bridge penalty** to the **R** budget
                        (b) KindBridge(s) declared with CL^k → attach the **kind‑bridge penalty** to the **R** budget
5. FreshnessPolicy:   LA freshness windows specified per slice; monitoring plan defined (if live)
6. IndependenceNote:  If SpanUnion is claimed, independence justification attached
7. TADecls:           Tools and their TA status listed; residual risk routed to R (not to F/G)
```

**Guard\_EvidenceAttach\_Typed** — attach concrete evidence to a state change.
*Plain reading.* The second macro checks that each attached evidence unit clearly states which row and column it covers, binds scope and membership in a reproducible way, applies bridge penalties to **R**, and respects freshness.

```
1. CellMatch:         Each evidence unit cites (subkind/mask, slice) it covers
2. PredicateBinding:  Evidence embeds Scope and MemberOf predicates (or references them verifiably)
3. BridgeApplied:     If evidence is bridged, apply the **scope‑bridge** and/or **kind‑bridge** penalties to **R**; record loss notes
4. FreshnessMet:      Evidence within declared freshness; else guard fails closed
5. VA/LA Mix:         If VA present, verify it matches the quantified Kind; if LA fills gaps, show matrix deltas
6. TAConsistent:      Tool versions match TA declarations used at planning time
```

##### C.3.A:B.8 Anti‑patterns & remedies

| Anti‑pattern                       | Why it’s risky                                | Remedy                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “We tested one golden case.”       | Hides variant risk; ignores subkinds.         | Build a subkind‑indexed matrix; add boundary tests per column.      |
| “Latest data suffices.”            | Non‑deterministic; un‑auditable.              | Declare `Γ_time` windows; fail closed on expiry.                    |
| “Tool is trusted, so we’re done.”  | Confuses TA with VA/LA; misses content risk.  | Keep TA separate; add VA proofs or LA tests as needed.              |
| Bridging without penalties         | Understates risk; mapping gaps surface later  | Apply **scope‑bridge** and **kind‑bridge** penalties to **R**; publish loss notes. |
| Widening G to cover evidence gaps. | Conflates applicability with available tests. | Keep G honest; expand matrix or lower claim scope explicitly (ΔG−). |
| Inferring scope from how many items match    | Scope is not the same as membership      | Keep **Scope** (where it applies) distinct from **membership** (which items match in the slice). |

##### C.3.A:B.9 End‑to‑end example (manager’s cheat‑sheet)  \[I]

**Scenario.** You want to publish “∀ x: PassengerCar. brakeDistance ≤ 50 m dry; ≤ 40 m wet” across two plants.

1. **Kinds.** `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle` (K2, signature F4).
2. **Scope (G).** `{surface in {dry, wet}, speed limits, rig version, time selector (Γ_time)=rolling 180 days}` in Plant‑A.
3. **VA.** Prove the property for **PassengerCar** using a proof assistant, and cite the **Scope** slices it assumes.
4. **LA.** Build an evidence matrix with rows `{PassengerCar}` and columns `{dry, up to 50}` and `{wet, up to 40}`, including rig variants; add boundary tests near the limits.
5. **TA.** Qualify the prover kernel and the automated checker used for wet surrogates.
6. **Bridge.** To Plant‑B: a **Scope Bridge** with **CL=2** (rig bias) and a **KindBridge** with **CL^k=3** (same classification).
7. **Penalties.** Apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** for CL=2 and the **kind‑bridge penalty** for CL^k=3 to **R**. Per policy, add extra test cells in Plant‑B to compensate for rig bias.
8. **Guards.** Use `Guard_EvidenceAttach_Typed` on the state change; include freshness checks.

**Outcome.** A defensible, auditable publication: typed, scoped, with clear evidence coverage and explicit risk penalties — no conflation of abstraction with applicability, and no tool risk smuggled into content.

#### C.3.A:Annex C. ESG guards

**Status note.** This profile restates the guard semantics from **§4** for ESG/Method contexts. It does **not** add obligations; where wording diverges, **§4 controls**.

##### C.3.A:C.1 **ESG** guard obligations (normative)

When a state transition publishes or affirms a claim that quantifies over kinds, the guard **SHALL**:

1. **Scope coverage (USM).**
   `U.ClaimScope(Claim) covers TargetSlice` (singleton or finite set) and TargetSlice **declares `Γ_time`** (no “latest”).

2. **Typed definedness.**
   A **deterministic membership check** is available for every kind used by the claim in the **TargetSlice**. If membership cannot be evaluated in that context, the guard **fails closed**.

3. **Typed compatibility (same Context).**
 If a downstream consumer expects a specific kind, then for each kind used by the claim either:
* the used kind is an **is‑a / subkind‑of** the expected kind, or
* a documented **RoleMask** for the expected kind is used and its constraints are **met and observable** in the **TargetSlice**.

3. **Typed compatibility (Cross‑context).**
  If any referenced kind is **used across Contexts**, a **KindBridge** **SHALL** be declared with a published **type‑congruence level** (minimum acceptable level per Context policy), order preserved (no inversions), and **loss notes**.
The guard **SHALL** apply the **kind‑bridge penalty** to **R**.

4. **Scope translation (Cross‑context claim use).**
If the Claim’s scope originates in another target‑context, a **Scope Bridge** with a published **congruence level** is required; apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** to **R**.

6. **Formality threshold (if gated).**
   If the ESG state requires rigor, enforce `U.Formality(Claim) ≥ F_k` (C.2.3).
   (*Note:* Raising F does **not** widen G; do not substitute.)

7. **Evidence freshness (R).**
   Where the new state implies trust, assert freshness windows and confirm **no expired bindings**.

**Prohibitions (normative).**

* Do **not** widen **G** to “hide” a type mismatch. Fix typed compatibility (introduce a subkind, use a RoleMask, publish a KindBridge) or reject.
* Do **not** treat a **mask name** as a kind—masks must be **registered** and **deterministic**.
* Do **not** infer G from the size of a kind’s **Extension**; **Scope ≠ Extension**.

##### C.3.A:C.2 - **Method–Work** guard obligations (normative)

To admit a **capability** for a specific **Work** step at **JobSlice**, the guard **SHALL**:

1. **Work scope coverage (USM).**
   The capability’s **Work scope** covers the **JobSlice**, and the **JobSlice** includes an explicit **time selector (Γ_time)**.

2. **Measures & qualification.**
   **All** required `U.WorkMeasures` hold at JobSlice and the `U.QualificationWindow` is **valid at `Γ_time`**.

3. **Typed inputs (same Context).**
   For each declared input kind (or RoleMask), assert:
   * **Membership check available:** the system can deterministically decide whether the input belongs to the expected kind in this **JobSlice**.
   * **Compatibility:** the provided input kind is an **is‑a / subkind‑of** the expected kind, or the **RoleMask** constraints are satisfied and observable.

3. **Typed outputs and post-conditions (if declared).**
   If the capability guarantees an output kind `k_out`, record the obligation to **demonstrate** `MemberOf(output, k_out, JobSlice)` (typically via conformance tests or audits).

4. **Cross‑context typed use.**
   If inputs and outputs are typed in a different target-context than the capability or JobSlice:
   * **KindBridge(s)** are required with a published **type‑congruence level** and **loss notes**; apply the **kind‑bridge penalty** to **R**.
   * If the capability resides in another target‑context, a **Scope Bridge** with a published **congruence level** is required; apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** to **R**.

4. **No substitution by G.**
   Do not “fix” a typed mismatch by widening the **Work scope**. Use an **adapter** or a **RoleMask**, or reject.

##### C.3.A:C.3 - Guard macros (ready‑to‑use)

**ESG\_TypedGate(Claim, TargetSlice, Kinds, thresholds)**
*Manager view:* The following macros are for editors; target‑contexts may automate them if desired. Managers can read the comments on each step; the checks are the same ones described in Plain language above.

```
1  assert ClaimScope(Claim) covers TargetSlice                 // USM
2  assert Γ_time(TargetSlice) is explicit                  // no "latest"
3  for each kind k in Kinds used by Claim:
4      assert membership_defined(k, TargetSlice)               // C.3.2 K-07
5  if same-Context typed expectations exist:
6      assert is_subkind(k, k_expected) OR meets_mask_constraints(k_expected, TargetSlice)
7  if cross-context kinds:
8      assert KindBridge(k, k') with type_congruence ≥ c_kind and loss notes
9      apply_kind_bridge_penalty(type_congruence)
10 if cross-context scope:
11     assert ScopeBridge(Claim.Context, TargetSlice.Context) with congruence ≥ c_scope
12     apply_scope_bridge_penalty(congruence)
13 if F-threshold applies: assert Formality(Claim) ≥ F_k        // C.2.3
14 if trust implied: assert Fresh(evidence, window) AND NoExpiredBindings
```

**MethodWork\_TypedGate(Capability, JobSlice, InputKinds, OutputKinds, thresholds)**

```
1  assert WorkScope(Capability) covers JobSlice                // USM
2  assert Γ_time(JobSlice) is explicit
3  assert WorkMeasures(JobSlice) satisfied AND QualificationWindow holds
4  for each expected input-kind k_in:
5      assert membership_defined(k_in, JobSlice)
6      assert is_subkind(k_input, k_in) OR meets_mask_constraints(k_in, JobSlice)
7  if declared output-kind k_out: record obligation to show MemberOf(output,k_out,JobSlice)
8  if cross-context kinds: assert KindBridge(… ) with type_congruence ≥ c_kind; apply_kind_bridge_penalty(type_congruence)
9  if cross-context capability/scope: assert ScopeBridge(… ) with congruence ≥ c_scope; apply_scope_bridge_penalty(congruence)
```

##### C.3.A:C.4 - Worked examples (manager‑focused)

**(A) ESG — Promote a braking policy to *Effective*.**
*Claim.* “For all **vehicles**: braking distance is **≤ 50 m** on dry and **≤ 40 m** on wet.”
*TargetSlice.* `{surface∈{dry,wet}, speed≤50 km/h, rig=v3, Γ_time=rolling 180 d}`
*Kinds.* `Vehicle` (K2, `KindSignature` at F4); the consumer subsystem expects `PassengerCar`.
**Guard.**

1. **Scope** covers TargetSlice (USM ✓).
2. **Definedness** of `MemberOf(?, Vehicle, TargetSlice)` ✓.
3. **Typed compatibility:** `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle` ✓.
4. **No bridges** → no penalties.
5. **F‑threshold:** `Formality(Claim) ≥ F4` ✓.
6. **Freshness:** evidence ≤ 180 days ✓.
   **Result:** Transition allowed. F/R apply weakest‑link on support paths; G remains the set declared.

**(B) Method–Work — Admit “RiskScore” step with typed input.**
*Capability.* `ComputeRiskScore` expects `AuthenticatedRequest`; promises SLOs (latency ≤ 50 ms, error ≤ 0.5 %).
*JobSlice.* `{api=v2.3, region=eu‑west, Γ_time=now, traffic_class=gold}`
*Inputs.* Producer emits `Request` (no auth guarantee).
**Guard.**

1. **Work scope** covers JobSlice; **Measures** & **QualificationWindow** ✓.
2. **Typed inputs:** `MemberOf(?, AuthenticatedRequest, JobSlice)` must hold. Not true for raw `Request`.
3. **Remedy:** insert an **adapter** that enforces/attests auth → yields `AuthenticatedRequest`.
4. **No Cross‑context** → no bridges.
   **Result:** Admitted **with adapter**; Scope unchanged; R relies on adapter evidence. Widening Work scope is **not** acceptable to bypass typed mismatch.

**(C) Cross‑context ESG — Adopt policy across plants.**
*Claim Context.* `SafetyLab@2026`. *target Context.* `PlantB@EU`.
*Kinds.* `Vehicle ↦ TransportUnit` via **KindBridge** with **`CL^k=2`** (EV/ICE collapsed); **Scope Bridge** from lab to plant with **CL=2** (rig bias ±2 %).
**Guard.**

1. Translate **Scope** and **cover** `TargetSlice_B`.
2. Translate **Kind** and ensure `MemberOf(?, TransportUnit, TargetSlice_B)` is **defined**.
3. Apply the **scope‑bridge penalty (level 2)** and the **kind‑bridge penalty (level 2)** to **R**; publish loss notes.
   **Result:** Transition allowed with reduced **R**; G is the **mapped** set; F unchanged.

##### C.3.A:C5 - Anti‑patterns & remedies (normative where noted)

| Anti‑pattern                                      | Why it’s wrong                                 | Remedy                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Widening **G** to “make kinds match”              | Conflates **entityOfConcern** with **applicability** | Introduce **subkind**, **RoleMask**, or **KindBridge**; keep G honest.              |
| Using a **mask name** as a kind                   | Hides constraints; breaks determinism          | Register mask; ensure constraints are observable; promote to **subkind** if reused. |
| Ignoring **`CL^k`** when classifying across Contexts | Under‑counts risk                              | Require **KindBridge**; apply **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R**; record loss notes.            |
| Inferring **Scope** from the size of the **Extension** | Scope is not the same as Extension            | Keep **Scope** (where it applies) distinct from **Extension** (which items count in the slice). |
| Implicit “**latest**” time                        | Non‑deterministic guard                        | Require explicit **`Γ_time`** (point/window/policy).                                |
