### A.19.CN:8 - Archetypal Grounding *(Tell‑Show‑Show)*

> **Same slots, three arenas; no tooling implied.** The examples below use plain-language normalization descriptions as placeholders; any normative use must cite A.19.UNM-governed ids/refs (A.19.UNM) and evidence pins (C.16), not invent new terminology here.

#### A.19.CN:8.1 - **Industrial line** — *Weld‑quality CN‑frame* (`AssemblyLine_2026`)

* `cs_basis`: *BeadWidth\[mm] (target 6.0±0.2)*, *Porosity\[ppm] (↓)*, *SeamRate\[1/min] (↑ until limit)*
* `chart`: reference jig, fixture ID, torch type; `MethodDescription#Weld_MIG_v3`
* `normalization`: affine rescale on gray‑level calibration → invariant = physical porosity
* `comparability`: **normalization‑based (UNM)** (calibration tables applied)
* `aggregation`: WLNK on quality (min‑bound), COMM on counts, time = per‑shift histograms
* **RSG hook**: `WelderRole.Ready` requires *Porosity ≤ 500 ppm* & *BeadWidth within ±0.2 mm* admitted by this CN‑frame.

#### A.19.CN:8.2 - **Software/SRE line** — *Latency CN‑frame* (`SRE_Prod_Cluster_EU_2026`)

* `cs_basis`: *P50Latency\[ms] (↓)*, *P99Latency\[ms] (↓)*, *Load\[req/s]*
* `chart`: client vantage, trace sampler v4; `MethodDescription#HTTP_probe_v4`
* `normalization`: monotone time‑warp compensation for collector skew; invariant = percentile order
* `comparability`: **normalization‑based (UNM)** with declared normalization
* `aggregation`: MONO on latency (max of mins), WLNK across services
* **RSG hook**: `DeployerRole.Active` gated if **P99** < declared SLO over the admission window.

#### A.19.CN:8.3 - **Clinical/episteme line** — *Trial‑outcome CN‑frame* (`Cardio_2026`)

* cs_basis:
  - slot_id: ΔBP
    characteristic: BloodPressureChange
    scale: { type: ratio, unit: mmHg }
    polarity: down
  - slot_id: AdverseRate
    characteristic: AdverseEventRate
    scale: { type: ratio, unit: "%" }
    polarity: down
  - slot_id: Age
    characteristic: Age
    scale: { type: ratio, unit: years }
    polarity: neutral
* `chart`: cohort definition; `MethodDescription#TrialProtocol_v5`
* `normalization`: case‑mix adjustment (propensity score); invariant = adjusted ΔBP
* `comparability`: **normalization‑based (UNM)** (post‑adjustment)
* `aggregation`: LOC on subcohorts; WLNK on safety outcomes
* **RSG hook**: `EvidenceRole.Validated` admission requires CN‑frame acceptance; **Assurance** pulls CL from any Bridge used.

#### A.19.CN:8.4 - Worked mini-schemas (entity/relational mixtures across CN‑frames, informative)

To illustrate how CharacteristicSpace is used in practice, below are simplified schema snippets for three typical **CN‑frames**: an **Operations** view (run-time state and action gating), an **Assurance** view (evidence and cross-context comparison), and an **Alignment** view (design-time consistency across contexts). These examples mix entity-based and relational Characteristics and demonstrate how normalization and bridge *references* may appear in a model.

**Didactic-only note (no data governance).** The “schema/table” shapes below are purely explanatory: they show which **references must be cite-able** for audit and reproducibility. They are **not** storage requirements, do not prescribe file formats, and do not define the semantics of `NormalizationMethod*` tokens (see A.19.UNM / C.16).

##### A.19.CN:8.4.1 - Operations CN‑frame — Run-time gating & enactment

_Entity graph view:_

Holder (System) ── playsRoleOf ──> Role@Context ── has ──> RCS (slots…)
RSG (Role@Context) ── lists ──> State (◉ status)
Checklist (of State) ── testedBy ──> Evaluation ── yields ──> StateAssertion
Work ── performedBy ──> RoleAssignment
Work ── isExecutionOf ──> MethodDescription

In the above, a **Holder** (a system instance) plays a **Role** in some Context, which has an attached **RCS** (a set of slots defining its characteristic space). That Role’s **RSG** lists various possible **State** entries (each state could be, e.g., Ready, Waiting, Degraded, etc.). Each State has a **Checklist** which is **tested by** an Evaluation process, resulting in a **StateAssertion** (pass/fail) at runtime. Meanwhile, **Work** instances (concrete operations) are performed by the RoleAssignment and correspond to some MethodDescription (procedure). The “gate” for Work is that a StateAssertion for an enactable state must exist.

_Relational stub:_ (illustrating how information might be recorded)

| Table | Key Columns (essential) |
| --- | --- |
| **ROLE\_ASSIGNMENT** | `RA_ID` (PK); `HOLDER_ID`; `ROLE_ID`; `CONTEXT_ID`; `WINDOW_FROM`, `WINDOW_TO` |
| **RCS\_SNAPSHOT** | `SNAP_ID` (PK); `RA_ID` (FK to ROLE\_ASSIGNMENT); `WINDOW_FROM`, `WINDOW_TO`; `CHAR_ID`; `VALUE`; `UNIT`; `SCALE_TYPE` |
| **RSG\_STATE** | `STATE_ID` (PK); `ROLE_ID`; `CONTEXT_ID`; `NAME`; `ENACTABLE` (bool) |
| **CHECKLIST** | `CHK_ID` (PK); `STATE_ID` (FK to RSG\_STATE); `PREDICATE_TYPE`; `PREDICATE_SPEC` |
| **STATE\_ASSERTION** | `SA_ID` (PK); `RA_ID` (FK); `STATE_ID` (FK); `CHK_ID` (FK); `WINDOW_FROM`, `WINDOW_TO`; `VERDICT` (pass/fail); `NORMALIZATION_INSTANCE_ID`?; `BRIDGE_ID`? |
| **WORK** | `WORK_ID` (PK); `RA_ID` (FK); `METHODDESC_ID` (FK to MethodDescription); `WINDOW_FROM`, `WINDOW_TO`; _(other fields like results or references)_ |

In this schema: an RCS snapshot table might log individual coordinate values (`VALUE`) for each Characteristic (`CHAR_ID`) in a given RoleAssignment, with their units and scale type noted (to ensure we know what the number means). The StateAssertion ties a RoleAssignment to a state checklist and says whether it passed, including references to any **NormalizationMethodInstance** or **Bridge** if cross-context or cross-scale comparisons were involved. The gate logic for enactment can then be a query like: “Is Work W admissible now?” – which joins through ROLE\_ASSIGNMENT to find the latest StateAssertion for that RA where `ENACTABLE=true` and `VERDICT=pass`.

##### A.19.CN:8.4.2 - Assurance CN‑frame — Evidence freshness & mapped comparisons

_Entity graph view:_

NormalizationMethodInstance ── appliesTo ──> Characteristic   (each instance is a scale‑appropriate, monotone transform within UNM)
Bridge (ContextB → ContextA)   (Alignment Bridge between contexts, with CL and loss notes)
StateAssertion ── uses ──> {NormalizationMethodInstance, Bridge}   (if a state comparison crossed contexts)

This view highlights that in the assurance context, we keep track of how we mapped or compared states:

* A **NormalizationMethodInstance** reference records that an admitted comparison/assertion relied on a declared normalization instance. The admissibility conditions, monotonicity constraints and evidence semantics are governed by **A.19.UNM** and **C.16**.
* A **Bridge** between Context B and Context A (for corresponding roles or states) carries a CL rating and possibly notes on what is “lost in translation.”
* A **StateAssertion** may **use** a NormalizationMethodInstance or a Bridge, meaning that assertion was reached by translating data via that instance or comparing across that bridge.

In this stub, **NORMALIZATION\_INSTANCE** records a mapping instance that has to be accounted for when reconstructing an assertion or comparison. The exact meaning of `FORMULA_SPEC`/`VALIDITY_WINDOW`/evidence pins is governed by the UNM and evidence patterns (A.19.UNM / C.16); the point here is that the instance is **referenceable** so audits can follow it. The Bridge table enumerates official Bridges between contexts (for example, bridging a “Ready” state in an engineering context to “Ready” in an operations context, with CL indicating how fully comparable they are). An ASSURANCE\_EVENT log could record when a penalty was applied due to a low-CL Bridge or when an assertion was refreshed or invalidated due to new evidence or time lapse.

##### A.19.CN:8.4.3 Alignment CN‑frame — Design-time reuse of states across Contexts

_Entity graph view:_

Checklist(ContextA.State)   ← pull(N) —   Checklist’(ContextB.State’)   (pull a checklist via **NormalizationMethodInstance** N)
Refinement π : RSG(Role' ≤ Role)   (RSG refinement mapping, e.g. Role' is a subtype of Role)

This view covers how _design-time_ alignment happens:

-   A **Checklist’** for a state in Context B can be **pulled** via a **NormalizationMethodInstance** into Context A to become a derived Checklist for a state in Context A. This is effectively what we described in the pull operation: using another context’s criteria in your own space.

-   A **Refinement π** is shown between RSGs indicating Role’ is a specialized role of Role (e.g. a sub-role or a scenario-specific role) and how their states relate (Role’ might have extra states or more granular distinctions). This refinement should maintain that for each state in Role’ that maps to a state in Role, the entails/implication relation holds for enactability.

| **RSG\_REFINEMENT** | `MAP_ID` (PK); `ROLEPRIME_ID` (FK to Role' in Context B); `ROLE_ID` (FK to Role in Context A); `STATEPRIME_ID` (FK to state in Role' RSG); `STATE_ID` (FK to state in Role RSG); `ENTAILS` (bool) |
| **CHECKLIST\_PULL** | `PULL_ID` (PK); `SRC_STATE_ID`; `TGT_STATE_ID`; `NORMALIZATION_INSTANCE_ID` (FK to NormalizationMethodInstance used); `VERSION`? /\* and perhaps timestamp \*/                                     |

In this stub, RSG\_REFINEMENT maps states of a sub-role to states of a super-role, with an `ENTAILS` flag indicating if being in the sub-state guarantees being in the super-state. **Every refinement mapping should ensure at least one enactable state in the sub-role corresponds to an enactable state in the super-role** (or else the sub-role would allow something the super-role doesn’t – that’s an alignment lint check). The CHECKLIST\_PULL table records that a state from one context has had its checklist pulled into another context via a **NormalizationMethodInstance** (identified by `NORMALIZATION_INSTANCE_ID`). This is a design-time description saying “State X in context A is defined by applying normalization instance N to State Y in context B’s criteria.” A version or validity field might ensure we know which edition of the checklist or normalization instance was used.
