### A.19.CN:11 - SCR / RSCR Harness (acceptance & regression)

> **These are concept‑level checks; notation‑agnostic.**

#### A.19.CN:11.1 - **SCR — Acceptance (first introduction)**

* **SCR‑A19.4‑S01 (Completeness).** **CN‑Spec has **all** mandatory slots; `cs_basis` include **unit, scale, and polarity**; `chart` references a `MethodDescription`.
* **SCR‑A19.4‑S02 (Normalization clarity).** `normalization` cites the UNM mechanism (`UNM_id?`) and provides the normalization references required by the A.19.UNM governing pattern (methods / invariants / fix, and instances when used). If instances are referenced in assurance logs, their evidence/backing and validity constraints are handled by the governing evidence pattern (C.16), not by A.19.CN.
* **SCR‑A19.4‑S03 (Comparability test).** Provide one worked example showing **coordinatewise** or **normalization‑based** comparison end‑to‑end (with Evidence Graph Ref).
* **SCR‑A19.4‑S04 (Γ‑fold audit).** Aggregation rule spells out WLNK/COMM/LOC/MONO choices; reviewer reconstructs result on a toy set.
* **SCR‑A19.4‑S05 (SoD).** Distinct `RoleAssignments` for `CN‑frameStewardRole` and `CN‑frameCertifierRole` exist; windows do not overlap.
* **SCR‑A19.4‑S06 (entityOfConcern & anchors surfaced).** For each CN‑Spec characteristic used in the worked example, cite the corresponding CHR Characteristic name and the evidence anchor(s) (A.10) that make the reading observable in this Context.

#### A.19.CN:11.2 - **RSCR — Regression (on change)**

* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R01 (UNM edit).** On changing `normalization` (UNM/NormalizationMethod), flag **all** downstream Bridges for CL re‑assessment; re‑run example comparisons.
* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R02 (Slot surgery/Basis surgery).** Adding/removing/renaming slot/basis requires a **new edition**; old data remain valid **for their edition**.
* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R03 (Chart drift).** Updating measurement protocol bumps edition; **historic Work** keeps old edition link.
* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R04 (Fold change).** Any change to `Γ_fold` invalidates cached roll‑ups; re‑compute or mark as superseded.
* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R05 (Bridge health).** After either side’s edition change, **re‑validate** Bridge CL and loss notes before accepting Cross‑context data.
* **RSCR‑A19.4‑R06 (Deprecation rule).** On deprecating a CN‑frame, Registry lists its successor; bridges re‑targeted or retired.
