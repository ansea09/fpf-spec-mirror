### F.12:10 - Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #       | Anti‑pattern                    | Symptom in practice                                                                          | Why it breaks thinking                          | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                                                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A1**  | **Plan‑as‑proof**               | A BPMN or runbook is cited as if it proved the SLO was met.                                  | Design artefacts are **not** occurrences.       | Apply **R1 attachment** + **R2 evidence**: attach the verdict to **ClauseCell\@Window about WorkCell** and require **Observations** of outcomes.              |
| **A2**  | **Signal‑as‑outcome**           | Control **Actuation** (setpoint writes, approvals) treated as evidence of delivered service. | Commands are intentions, not results.           | Accept only **MeasureCell** that **about‑refer** to the **same Work**; if a control signal is used as proxy, declare a **Bridge(kind=proxy, CL, Loss)**. |
| **A3**  | **Windowless verdict**          | “We met the SLA” with no stated period or scope.                                             | Unfalsifiable; mixes populations.               | Enforce **R5 Window**: every verdict names a **Window** (month, batch, incident interval).                                                               |
| **A4**  | **Global words**                | *Availability*, *latency* used without a Context.                                               | Collides senses across disciplines.             | Speak with **Context prefixes** (F.1). Cross‑context reuse demands a **Bridge** (F.9).                                                                         |
| **A5**  | **Percentile mirage**           | p95 computed on a pooled year while the clause is monthly.                                   | Predicate and Window misaligned.                | **R3 Predicate** + **R5 Window**: compute the statistic **per Clause’s Window**.                                                                         |
| **A6**  | **Proxy blindness**             | Synthetic probes stand in for user experience with no limitations stated.                    | Proxies miss geography, jitter, or pathologies. | Declare **Bridge(kind=proxy, CL, Loss)**. If proxy coverage is insufficient for the clause scope, the verdict is **Inconclusive**.                                                |
| **A7**  | **Scope drift (Work mismatch)** | Measured another product’s or region’s traffic but judged the whole service.                 | Evidence is about the wrong **Work**.           | Tie **MeasureCell** to the **same WorkCell** (or a stated population‑of‑Works) as the Clause scopes.                                                     |
| **A8**  | **Retroactive renorm**          | A new clause or recalibrated monitor silently rewrites past verdicts.                        | Violates temporal honesty.                      | Enforce **Non‑retroactivity** (Inv‑6): past verdicts stand; new rules apply forward.                                                                     |
| **A9**  | **Silent units**                | “Latency ≤ 120” with no unit or scale.                                                       | Ambiguous thresholds.                           | **KD‑CAL discipline**: state **Characteristic, Scale, Unit** on **MeasureCell**.                                                                         |
| **A10** | **Hidden aggregation**          | “Global availability” but only a subset of regions/slices was covered.                       | Over‑claims evidence.                           | State the **aggregation scope** explicitly or confine the verdict to the observed subset; otherwise **Inconclusive**.                                    |
| **A11** | **Status on “the service”**     | Tagging an abstract umbrella like *“the service”* as “Satisfied”.                            | Loses the entityOfConcern of the judgement.           | Attach to **ClauseCell\@Window about WorkCell**; the service concept remains a promise vocabulary (A.2.3).                                               |
| **A12** | **Bridge‑by‑name**              | Equating *Activity* ≡ *Process* because both say “process”.                                  | Assumes global meaning.                         | Use **F.9 Bridge** with **kind/CL/Loss**; or keep them distinct.                                                                                         |
