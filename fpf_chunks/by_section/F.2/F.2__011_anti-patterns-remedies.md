### F.2:10 - Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #       | Anti‑pattern                 | Symptom (in thought or prose)                                        | Why harmful                                                  | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A1**  | **Global normal form**       | One “canonical” label reused across Contexts.                           | Erases local meaning; invites stealth bridges.               | Keep **LNF per Context**; any Cross‑context relation belongs to **F.9** only.                                 |
| **A2**  | **String = meaning**         | Assuming identical strings denote one concept across Contexts.          | Homonym collision (*process*, *role*, *service*).            | Always prefix mentally with the **Context**; treat same string in different Contexts as **different units**.  |
| **A3**  | **Over‑normalisation**       | Folding hyphens/case/morphology “for consistency”.                   | Loses the canon’s idiom; breaks citations.                   | **Minimal edits** toward the Context’s idiom; never toward a global house‑style.                           |
| **A4**  | **Headless multiword**       | Truncating to a head (“objective” for “service‑level objective”).    | Ambiguity; collapses scope.                                  | Preserve canonical **head‑modifier** as LNF when meaningful.                                            |
| **A5**  | **Premature structure**      | Embedding behaviour, deontics, units, or type axioms into the gloss. | EntityOfConcern / Description / specification-use mixing (violates A.7); biases later patterns.          | Gloss **usage**, not calculus; structural content belongs to Extention Patterns in Part C.                   |
| **A6**  | **Cross‑context folding**       | “BPMN workflow ≈ PROV activity” written inside F.2.                   | Hidden bridge; unpriced losses.                              | No Cross‑context claims in F.2; write the **itch to bridge** for **F.9**.                                  |
| **A7**  | **Edition blur**             | “BPMN” without year/profile; mixing excerpts across editions.        | Silent sense shift; unrepeatable reasoning.                  | Treat distinct editions as **distinct Contexts** in F.1, then harvest.                                     |
| **A8**  | **Vendor‑dialect elevation** | Treating a DSL/keyword list as “the domain”.                         | Projectionism; narrow idiom dominates.                       | If needed, model the DSL as **one context among others**; keep heterogeneity from F.1.                     |
| **A9**  | **Tail chasing**             | Harvesting hundreds of rare terms.                                   | Cognitive overload; dilutes signal.                          | Keep **head terms** that feed F.3/F.4/F.9; justify rare units by their bridging value.                  |
| **A10** | **Fake symmetry**            | Tech and Plain labels are identical jargon.                          | Didactic failure.                                            | Make **Plain** genuinely explanatory; keep **Tech** faithful to the canon.                              |
| **A11** | **Temporal fudge**           | Using run‑time words in design Contexts (or vice versa).                | Category drift; later contradictions.                        | Respect the Context’s **DesignRunTag** from its Card (F.1 §7.2).                                      |
| **A12** | **Cross‑language collapse**  | Merging bilingual terms as one unit.                                 | Erases idiom‑specific signals; hides normative mapping gaps. | Treat each language edition as its **own Context** unless the canon declares a normative mapping.          |
| **A13** | **Alias inflation**          | Inventing new local names “for clarity”.                             | Strays from the canon; hinders bridging.                     | Prefer the canon’s idiom; keep invented phrasings to the **Plain** register only.                       |
| **A14** | **Role/status conflation**   | RBAC “role” glossed as behavioural role.                             | Cross‑family bleed; wrong assignment later.                         | Call out the Context in the label: **access‑role (RBAC)** vs **participant (BPMN)**; keep senses disjoint. |
