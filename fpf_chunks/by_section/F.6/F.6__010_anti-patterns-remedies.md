### F.6:9 - Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #         | Anti‑pattern                   | Symptom                                                                                     | Why it harms reasoning                                                     | Remedy (conceptual move)                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AP-1**  | **cross-context Binding**      | A single binding/assertion mixes two Contexts (status/role in C₁ justified by semantics in C₂) without an explicit Bridge. | Violates **Locality**; smuggles a Bridge (kind/CL/Loss) into the claim, making it hard to replay and easy to treat as free substitution. | Re-formulate strictly in one context. If cross-context support is essential, apply **F.9 Bridge** and keep the assignment/status claim local. |
| **AP‑2**  | **Role and Status Conflation**     | “Operator” modeled as a deontic grant; “SLO met” modeled as a Role.                         | Collapses **behavioural mask** and **epistemic/deontic state** (A.7).      | Re‑type the Template: **Role** for “can/does”, **Status** for “is/has (as a claim)”. Use **M4** accordingly.                 |
| **AP‑3**  | **Window‑less Claims**         | Binding/assertion with no time stance or interval.                                          | Uncheckable; invites retrospective reinterpretation.                       | Make **Window** explicit (§6 M4). Inherit stance from the Context/Template if fixed; otherwise state it.                        |
| **AP‑4**  | **Eligibility‑after‑the‑fact** | Declaring the claim, then back‑fitting eligibility to observed traces.                      | Confuses **necessary conditions** with **diagnostics**; risks circularity. | Perform **M3 Qualify** *before* **M4 Bind/Assert**; treat evidence only in **M5**/**M6**.                                    |
| **AP‑5**  | **Global Label Illusion**      | Using bare labels (“process”, “agent”, “role”) as if universal.                             | Hides the Context; fuels homonym errors.                                      | Always recover **M1 Locate**: `address(τ)=⟨Context, SenseCell⟩`. Use F.5 naming discipline (Tech/Plain registers).              |
| **AP‑6**  | **Evidence by Prestige**       | “Industry practice says …” offered instead of KD‑CAL‑shaped facts.                          | Replaces observable Results with authority talk.                           | State an **evidence shape Σ(Context)** in **M5**; later fill it with **Observation/Result** facts (KD‑CAL).                     |
| **AP‑7**  | **DesignRunTag Inversion**       | Verifying a design‑time mask by design documents; verifying a run‑status with design specs. | Violates DesignRunTag; yields non‑falsifiable claims.                   | Apply **M2 Stance**: the Template’s stance must be compatible with the Context. Evidence follows the stance.                    |
| **AP-8**  | **Premature Bridge**           | A Bridge is introduced as a shortcut (“align first, then claim”), instead of stating the assignment/status locally and adding a Bridge only when actually needed. | Makes the verdict hostage to an uncertain translation; Bridge Loss and CL penalties leak into the claim and can unnecessarily lower confidence. | Keep the assignment/status claim local; if needed, create an **F.9 Bridge** with loss notes and CL penalty. |
| **AP‑9**  | **Token Proofs**               | Single anecdotal event taken as universal confirmation.                                     | Over‑generalises; ignores evidence windows and procedures.                 | In **M5**, include **Procedure** and **Window**; in **M6**, roll confidence γ from adequacy of sampling (KD‑CAL).            |
| **AP‑10** | **Role Explosion as Patch**    | New Role minted for every exception.                                                        | Name bloat; brittle semantics.                                             | Re‑examine **eligibility** and **Window**; consider a **Status** to mark exceptions instead of new Roles.                    |
| **AP‑11** | **Subject Drift**              | Status asserted on the wrong subject (team vs service; asset vs dataset).                   | Breaks referent clarity; evidence no longer matches.                       | Use **M4**’s split: **plays\_role(H, …)** vs **has\_status(subject(H), …)**; pick the correct subject kind.                  |
| **AP‑12** | **Spec‑in‑Name**               | Cramming constraints into the label (“24x7‑Operator‑With‑Pager”).                           | Names become brittle; invariants become invisible.                         | Keep the label minimal (F.5); move constraints into **eligibility**/**invariants**.                                          |
| **AP‑13** | **Non‑Local Evidence Shape**   | Evidence shape mentions constructs from another Context.                                       | Hidden Cross‑context import.                                                  | Rewrite Σ using only this Context’s vocabulary; if impossible, use **F.9** Bridge and keep Σ local.                             |
