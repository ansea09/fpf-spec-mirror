### G.11:9 - Consequences (informative)

* **Selective, replayable upkeep.** Refresh becomes a controlled planning and execution loop rather than an implicit “maintenance vibe.”
* **Stable semantics with flexible operations.** Trigger meaning is centralized (`G.Core`), while scheduling sophistication can evolve as policy-bound extensions.
* **Clear governing-definition assignment boundaries.** Orchestration coordinates governing definitions; it does not redefine their semantics (shipping remains `G.10`, selection remains `G.5`, etc.).
* **Cost: pin discipline overhead.** Authors must carry enough ids, editions, and policies to make refresh comparable. This is intentional: it replaces hidden drift with explicit wiring.
