### G.11:11 - SoTA-Echoing — Post‑2015 practices aligned (informative)

Each entry follows: **claim → practice → source → alignment → adoption status**.

0. **Queue-7 QD currentness requires visible survey support.**
   Practice: current QD work is surveyed as approaches, applications, and challenges, with archive, diversity, descriptor, and evaluator-currentness concerns still live.
   Source: `A survey on Quality-Diversity optimization: Approaches, applications, and challenges`, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation 2026, DOI `10.1016/j.swevo.2025.102240`.
   Alignment: `RefreshCurrentnessLine@Context` may name selected set, `Front`, `Q-front`, `ExplorationArchive`, `Archive`, portfolio lineage, descriptor or distance edition, and path-slice scope, while `C.18`, `C.19`, and `G.5` keep archive, pool, and selected-set meanings.
   Adoption: **Adopt and bound** (survey support changes refresh currentness fields and boundaries; it is not the governing ontology source).

0a. **Open-ended engineering outputs need source and evaluator currentness.**
   Practice: self-improving-agent, AlphaEvolve-style, and DeepEvolve-style lines use generated variants, external knowledge, evaluators, tests, archives, and empirical validation.
   Source: Darwin Godel Machine, AlphaEvolve, and Deep Research augmentation source rows selected by the DRR.
   Alignment: G.11 refresh records carry source, evaluator, descriptor, policy, edition, lineage, and report refs; generated method text, evaluator success, and archive update keep their governing patterns.
   Adoption: **Adopt and adapt** (refresh tracks currentness and smallest affected scope; it does not accept generated text as proof, gate passage, or performed work).

1. **Continuous refresh is necessary in deployed evaluation pipelines.**
   Practice: production ML systems use monitoring, retraining, and reevaluation triggers and insist on reproducibility hooks.
   Source: Breck et al., *The ML Test Score* (2017); Amershi et al., *Software Engineering for Machine Learning* (2019).
   Alignment: `G.11` formalizes triggers as typed causes and forces edition and policy pins for replay.
   Adoption: **Adopt and adapt** (adapted to id-based, PathSlice-scoped refresh rather than “retrain everything”).

2. **Non-stationarity requires explicit drift and decay handling, not ad-hoc updates.**
   Practice: continual learning emphasizes non-stationarity as a first-class maintenance condition.
   Source: Parisi et al., *Continual Lifelong Learning with Neural Networks* (2019); De Lange et al., *A Continual Learning Survey* (2021).
   Alignment: `B.3.4` supplies decay semantics; `G.11` wires decay events into refresh planning and controlled deprecation.
   Adoption: **Adapt** (refresh of conceptual artefacts and evidence closures, not untracked model mutation).

3. **Quality-Diversity requires archive semantics and comparability under descriptor and distance evolution.**
   Practice: QD methods treat the archive as the primary result and track changes under policy and edition conditions.
   Source: contemporary QD families such as CMA‑ME (post‑2018) and differentiable QD lines (post‑2019).
   Alignment: QD-specific meaning lives with the governing patterns; `G.11:Ext.QDRefreshWiring` ensures edition pins and scope pins exist so targeted archive refresh is admissible.
   Adoption: **Adopt** (set and archive preservation; no covert scalarization).

4. **Open-endedness co-evolves environments and agents; transfer rules must be versioned.**
   Practice: POET-class open-ended systems require explicit transfer rules and environment validity constraints.
   Source: Wang et al., POET (2019) and subsequent POET extensions (2020+).
   Alignment: `G.11:Ext.OEERefreshWiring` requires `TransferRulesRef.edition` and scope pins so refresh reruns remain comparable and auditable.
   Adoption: **Adopt and adapt** (adapted to Part G pin and UTS publication discipline).

5. **Efficient orchestration benefits from bandit and early-stopping scheduling, but it must not become semantics.**
   Practice: modern hyperparameter and experiment scheduling uses bandit-style resource allocation and asynchronous early stopping.
   Source: Async Hyperband and BOHB-style work (2018+) as representative post‑2015 scheduling practice.
   Alignment: scheduling is expressed as `RefreshQueue` and `RefreshPlan@Context` policy pins (`RefreshPriorityPolicyIdRef`, `BudgetDeclRef`) so core semantics remain stable and WorkPlanning stays separate from executed Work.
   Adoption: **Adapt** (useful practice, but quarantined outside core norms).
