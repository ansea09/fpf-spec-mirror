### G.11:3 - Forces — Minimal recomputation under strict invariants

* **Minimal scope vs. completeness.** Refresh must be *as local as possible* (slice-scoped), but still include a defensible dependency closure over evidence and crossings.
* **Operational urgency vs. auditability.** Refresh is triggered by run-time telemetry and decay, yet must remain auditable as Work (pins, refs, paths), not as opaque “decisions.”
* **Alias stability vs. semantic unification.** Existing trigger labels must remain usable, but their meaning must be one governing definition and id-based.
* **Modularity vs. orchestration power.** `G.11` must coordinate harvesting/parity/shipping without re-implementing them or importing discipline-specific method semantics into core.
* **Policy-bound behavior vs. “smart defaults.”** Ordering of refresh, priority heuristics, and budget handling are valuable—but must live as policy-bound extensions, not as hidden universal rules.
