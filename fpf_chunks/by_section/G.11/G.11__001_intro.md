## G.11 - Telemetry-Driven Refresh and Decay Orchestrator

**Tag.** Architectural pattern (architectural; notation-independent)
> **Status:** Stable
**Normativity.** Normative (unless explicitly marked informative)

**Stage.** run-time and maintenance-time (selective re-computation, republication, and controlled deprecation)

**Primary outputs, when their use calls for them.** `RefreshQueue`, `RefreshPlan@Context` (a local application name for one exact `U.WorkPlan`, not a new kind), `RefreshReport@Context` (record of refresh Work or its audit), `DeprecationNotice@Context`, and `EditionBumpLog@Context`. Continued reliance on an already applicable result requires none of these solely to prove that refresh was omitted.

**Primary hooks.** `G.Core` (RSCR trigger catalogue, alias docking, and Default Governing Definition Index), `G.6` (EvidenceGraph; `PathId` and `PathSliceId`), `G.7` (Bridge Sentinels; CL, Φ, and plane policy pins), `G.5` (set-returning selection and dispatch), `G.8` (SoS-LOGBundle telemetry hooks), `G.9` (parity reruns), `G.10` (shipping hooks and pack-level telemetry pins), `G.12` (dashboard telemetry pins), `B.3.4` (freshness and decay), `E.18` (GateCrossing and CrossingBundle visibility), `C.18` and `C.19` archive, front, and live-pool policy pins, `C.23` (SoS-LOG branches and maturity ladders), `C.28` (causal-use support results whose SoTA-sensitive fields can change downstream causal-use results).

**Non-duplication note.**
`G.11` cites `G.Core` for RSCR trigger-kind meaning, CN and CG admissibility, tri-state guards, penalties, set-return semantics, shipping or harvesting delegation, `RSCRTriggerKindId` values, and default governing definitions.
Refresh plans and reports cite those governed definitions; they do not create local trigger meanings or default definitions inside the refresh record.
