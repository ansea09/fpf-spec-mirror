### G.11:6 - Bias-Annotation (informative)

Lenses tested: **Gov**, **Arch**, **Onto and Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**.

* **Arch bias (toward explicit wiring).** Risk: authors feel “over-pinned.” Mitigation: keep the minimum pin set small; push scheduling sophistication into extensions and policies.
* **Gov bias (toward audit over speed).** Risk: refresh becomes bureaucratic. Mitigation: the kit is intentionally thin: refresh queue entries, `RefreshPlan@Context`, and `RefreshReport@Context` stay explicit, while action semantics remain delegated to governing definitions.
* **Onto and Epist bias (toward one governing definition semantics).** Risk: teams try to localize trigger meaning for convenience. Mitigation: alias docking is allowed, but semantics stay in `G.Core`.
* **Prag bias (toward minimal recomputation).** Risk: under-refresh if closure is too narrow. Mitigation: require closure rationale and allow explicit “scope wideners” as policy-bound pins.
* **Did bias (toward readable, reusable artefacts).** Risk: oversimplified examples. Mitigation: maintain System and Episteme grounding and keep SoTA-echoing explicit.
