### C.24:10 - Rationale

`C.24` exists because tool-use systems fail in a distinctive way: they can look adaptive while actually hiding route choice, budget burn, stop conditions, and replan logic inside one opaque execution chain. A separate planning calculus is therefore necessary so that tool use remains auditable, replayable, and governable before the first irreversible call is made.

- Contemporary tool-use systems in agential roles work best when planning, feedback, and replanning stay explicit rather than collapsing into one brittle script. The practical implication is to publish one `U.WorkPlan` that cites route descriptions and carries stop or replan triggers before execution.
- Post-2015 search, optimization, and agentic systems also show that bounded probing is useful but dangerous when it silently becomes commitment. The safeguard here is the explicit `CheckpointReturn` plus visible commit trigger and one explicit split between planned budget envelope and burned actual budget.
- Scaling-first practice favors general, learnable methods over fragile hand-tuned tactics when assurance and cost remain comparable. The practical implication is not blind optimism but disciplined BLP: when a narrow heuristic wins, record the waiver, expiry, and re-evaluation window.
