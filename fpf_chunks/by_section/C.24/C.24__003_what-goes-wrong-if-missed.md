### C.24:0.1 - What goes wrong if missed

- calls get scheduled by ad-hoc heuristics, so the plan cannot say which budget is being burned or what event should stop or replan execution
- planning quietly collapses into execution, or execution quietly inherits unresolved upstream choice and pool-policy questions
- a successful probe is mistaken for committed rollout even though the commit trigger was never made explicit
