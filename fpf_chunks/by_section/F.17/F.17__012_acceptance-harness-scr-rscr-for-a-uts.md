### F.17:11 - Acceptance Harness (SCR/RSCR) for a UTS

#### F.17:11.1 - Static Conformance Rules (SCR‑UTS)

* **SCR‑UTS‑01 (Row completeness).** Each row contains: `U.Type`, `Tech`, `Plain`, `FPF Description`, `SenseCells (≥ 1)`, `Rationale`.
* **SCR‑UTS‑02 (Dual register).** Each row has both Tech and Plain labels; Tech is used in spec prose, Plain in didactics.
* **SCR‑UTS‑03 (Locality discipline).** Every SenseCell is cited **with its Context name & edition**.
* **SCR‑UTS‑04 (Heterogeneity).** Across the sheet, the set of referenced Context spans **≥ 3 domain families**.
* **SCR‑UTS‑05 (Bridge honesty).** All cross‑context sameness claims are expressed via an F.9 **Bridge** with a **CL** score; if identity, mark **CL=3** and note “identity/no loss” rather than omitting the bridge.
* **SCR‑UTS‑06 (One‑breath rationale).** The rationale is ≤ 35 words and states the **conceptual invariant** that unifies the row.
* **SCR‑UTS‑07 (Block parsimony).** Block Plan uses **≤ 7 blocks**; each block’s rows can be recited from memory by a careful reader.
* **SCR‑UTS‑08 (Strict Distinction).** No row description conflates Method↔MethodDescription, Work↔WorkDescription, Role↔RoleCharacterisation.
* **SCR‑UTS‑09 (Unified naming).** Each row’s **Unified Tech name** complies with F.5 rules (dual register, minimal generality, morphology); it is not a mere alias of one Context unless justified by an F.9 Bridge with **CL=3**.
* **SCR‑UTS‑10 (Column discipline).** **Layout A:** all non‑left‑rail columns are **Contexts** with editions. **Layout B:** all non‑left‑rail columns are **discipline columns**. No cross‑use.
* **SCR‑UTS‑11 (Plain‑twin hygiene).** The **Unified Plain name** appears **once** in the **left rail** (**tv:primary**). Neither BCC (Layout A) nor DC (Layout B) cells may introduce alternative **unified** Plain synonyms; use the ⚡ marker in `Notes` to flag homonym risk where needed.

#### F.17:11.2 - Regression Rules (RSCR‑UTS)

* **RSCR‑UTS‑A (Edition churn).** When a Context’s edition changes, old SenseCells remain addressable; new cells are added; **no silent rewrites**.
* **RSCR‑UTS‑B (Name stability).** Tech labels change only with a documented F.5 decision; Plain labels may evolve didactically if the Tech name stays.
* **RSCR‑UTS‑C (Coverage drift).** Adding/removing rows **must not** reduce family heterogeneity below §9.3.
* **RSCR‑UTS‑D (Loss drift).** If new evidence changes a Bridge’s CL/Loss, the row updates both the CL and the 2–6 word loss note.
* **RSCR‑UTS‑E (Plain discipline).** No per‑column Plain text appears in BCC/DC columns; any additional Plain aliases are tracked in Annex with **tv:** entries and counted against the alias budget (F.13).
