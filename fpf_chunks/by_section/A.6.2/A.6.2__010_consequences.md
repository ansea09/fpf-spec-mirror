### A.6.2:9 - Consequences

* **Single place for episteme‑to‑episteme laws.**
  All effect‑free transforms of knowledge epistemes or publications, across KD‑CAL, MVPK, E.TGA, discipline packs, can now be defined as species of EFEM, instead of each family re‑inventing its own law set.

* **Clear separation from mechanisms & work.**
  Anything that touches the world (measurements, execution, simulation) is forced into `U.Mechanism` / `U.WorkEnactment`, with CL‑penalised Bridges and Γ_time; EFEM remains pure and compositional.

* **Stable backbone for Viewing & Retargeting.**
  A.6.3 and A.6.4 do not need to repeat P0–P5; they specialise EFEM with additional constraints (preserve/retarget). Other patterns (e.g. MultiViewDescribing, MVPK, E.TGA StructuralReinterpretation) can depend on EFEM as a stable base.

* **Slot‑level clarity.**
  By formulating EFEM laws in terms of SlotKinds/ValueKinds/RefKinds (A.6.5) and the EpistemeSlotGraph (C.2.1), it becomes much harder for Episteme to confuse “described entity”, “slot in a relation”, and “reference to that entity”.

* **Better didactics.**
  The old “semantic triangle” becomes a didactic projection of EFEM over the EpistemeSlotGraph: EFEM + C.2.1 explain precisely what the triangle was trying to gesture at (symbol, concept, object), while correctly foregrounding operations, viewpoints, grounding holons, and reference schemes.
