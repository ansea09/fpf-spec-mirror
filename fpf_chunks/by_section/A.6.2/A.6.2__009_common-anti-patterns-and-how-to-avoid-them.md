### A.6.2:7.1 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Correct action |
|---|---|---|
| EFEM as performed work | An episteme rewrite is treated as measurement, actuation, or work occurrence. | Use EFEM only for episteme-to-episteme morphisms; use A.15 when work in the world is current. |
| EFEM as publication rendering | A face, carrier, or rendering change is treated as the episteme morphism itself. | Use E.17 for publication forms and use EFEM only for the episteme relation being represented. |
| Retargeting as harmless view | Endpoint epistemes concern different entities, but the bounded-use proposition or current case remains unstated. | Identify the A.6.4 arrow; write `q` with its invariant, visible loss, use, conditions, and polarity; then report the current-case judgement from exact facts. Add F.9 only for a separate local-sense relation. |
| Representation lens as ontology | A category arrow, graph, or mapping notation is treated as a new root U-kind. | Keep the mathematical object as the lens over the EFEM relation and keep U-kind settlement in E.24/C.3. |
