### A.6.2:10.1 - SoTA-Echoing (informative, lineage)

EFEM is intentionally “thin”: it provides a **minimal categorical and slot‑based discipline** for episteme→episteme morphisms, making it easy to align with several post‑2015 lines of work:

* **Categorical semantics & displayed categories.**
  Treating `Ep` as a category over `Ref` via a functor `α : Ep → Ref` (mapping each episteme to its EntityOfConcern) matches the *displayed categories* view on fibrations: EFEM arrows are those morphisms in `Ep` that are “vertical” (preserve α) or “structured reindexings” (retarget under a KindBridge). This is exactly the intended alignment with C.2.1’s subjectRef/ReferencePlane picture.

* **Optics as universal projections.**
  Viewing operations (`U.EpistemicViewing`) refine EFEM in a way analogous to **lenses/prisms/traversals** in the optics literature: effect‑free, compositional accessors for parts of a larger structure. EFEM captures the laws that underlie those projections (purity, conservation, functoriality); optics‑style constructions can then be used inside discipline packs without modifying the core.

* **Structured cospans & correspondences.**
  Many correspondence‑based multi‑view patterns (ISO 42010 correspondences, model synchronisation, traceability links) can be seen as spans/cospans between epistemes. EFEM ensures that the legs of such cospans are effect‑free and conservative, while CorrespondenceModels carry the extra structure needed for consistency management.

* **Bidirectional transformations (BX).**
  The “no new commitments” and “functorial & idempotent” constraints mirror modern BX practice around **consistency restoration**: EFEM is the universal core that BX‑like constructions (view updates, synchronisers) must respect when instantiated for epistemes.

EFEM does *not* prescribe a specific calculus (deductive, probabilistic, latent‑space), nor a specific representation (symbolic vs distributed); those choices are captured in `U.ClaimGraph`, `U.RepresentationScheme` and discipline‑level patterns. EFEM only says what it means to transform epistemes **admissibly** in that chosen substrate.
