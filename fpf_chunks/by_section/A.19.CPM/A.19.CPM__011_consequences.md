### A.19.CPM:9 - Consequences

* **Improved usability (didactic):** CPM gives a single, engineer‑readable place to learn “what admissible comparison means” and what it does *not* mean.
* **Higher replayability:** comparison results remain traceable through dated comparison `U.Work`, the actual `Compare` application and its `ComparisonResultSlot` binding, the A.10 evidence-provenance path, any consumed obtaining F.9 `Bridge` with its separate bounded-use claim, and any applicable ReferencePlane relation and policy.
* **Reduced semantic drift:** teams cannot silently shift from Pareto to lexicographic to “weighted sum” without changing explicit comparator specs and pins.
* **Explicit tradeoffs:** set‑valued outcomes force downstream reasoning to acknowledge incomparability and uncertainty rather than hiding them.
* **Cost:** downstream consumers (notably selection) must handle sets, abstentions, and partial orders explicitly. This is intentional: it moves complexity from hidden heuristics into explicit policy‑bound mechanisms.
