### A.6.3:6 - Consequences

* **Clear separation of viewing vs retargeting.**
  `U.EpistemicViewing` and `U.EpistemicRetargeting` (A.6.4) now **cleanly separate**:

  * “view of the same EntityOfConcern” vs “description of a different entity under a bridge”, and
  * vertical morphisms (`α` fixed) vs retargeting morphisms (α changes under KindBridge).

* **Stable backbone for multi‑view patterns.**
  Multi‑view description (E.17.0), viewpoint bundle libraries (E.17.1/E.17.2), and MVPK publication now share a **single notion of view morphism**, aligned with C.2.1 slots and the EntityOfConcern and Description-episteme boundary and specification use/refinement discipline.

* **SlotKind-specific discipline for tools.**
  Tools implementing views (queries, projections, report generators, LLM‑based summarisation) must declare:

  * which SlotKinds they read,
  * which SlotKinds they may write,
  * and that `EntityOfConcernSlot` is preserved.
    This removes ambiguity around subject/EntityOfConcern changes and enables robust static checking.

* **Alignment with modern view/query practices.**
  The pattern aligns with:
  * ISO 42010:2011/2022 and its focus on **viewpoints**, **views**, and **correspondences** over an entity of concern;
  * SysML v2 “views‑as‑queries” paradigm, where views are queries over a stable model, not new models;
  * post‑2015 work on **optics** and **displayed categories**, treating views as structured projections over a fibred category of epistemes.
