### A.6.9:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| ID            | Anti‑pattern           | Example                                              | Why it breaks                                           | Remedy                                                               |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AP‑XCTX‑1** | Bridge‑by‑adjective    | “A is the same as B (across contexts).”              | Smuggles scope + direction + loss as implicit defaults. | Replace with Bridge Card + explicit `scope`.                         |
| **AP‑XCTX‑3** | Stealth substitution   | “We’ll just treat A like B for now.”                 | Introduces implicit licence without CL and Loss gates.      | Publish Bridge Card; if CL<2, keep `Naming-only`.                    |
| **AP‑XCTX‑2** | Symmetry hallucination | Treating `⊑/⊒` as symmetric “equivalence”.           | Causes unsafe inverse substitution.                     | Record `kind` and `dir`. Only symmetric kinds (`≈`, `⋂`, `⊥`, `⇄ᴅʀ`) may be written as `A↔B`; inclusion kinds require direction; substitution is always directional. |
| **AP‑XCTX‑4** | Lossless fantasy       | “Equivalent” with no loss note.                      | Loss is almost always present; hiding it misleads decisions.       | State Loss notes (even if “none”), add a counter-example (CL≤2) or invariants (CL=3); adjust CL and scope accordingly. |
| **AP‑XCTX‑5** | Silent inversion       | Later prose uses B→A without redeclaration.          | Violates direction guard; breaks auditability.          | Declare inverse Bridge (new id) or withdraw+replace.                 |
| **AP‑XCTX‑6** | Confidence laundering  | Raising CL or scope without new invariants or evidence. | Inflates trust; expands row scopes illegitimately.      | Use `adjustCL` or `rescope` with witnessRefs and DRR.                     |
| **AP‑XCTX‑7** | Chain upgrade          | Treating A↠B and B↠C as “therefore A≈C”.             | Violates weakest‑link and loss accumulation.            | Use min‑CL and accumulated Loss; avoid chaining unless justified.    |
| **AP‑XCTX‑8** | Conditional scope smuggling | “Naming‑only generally; substitution in workflow X.” | Encodes two licences in one record; leaks into row scope and downstream reasoning. | Refine endpoints (SenseCell split) and declare a separate Bridge for the guarded subset; keep broad Bridge Naming‑only. |
| **AP‑XCTX‑9** | Artefact⇒equivalence fallacy | “There is a mapping table, so they are the same.” | Confuses operational transformation with semantic licence; hides Loss and direction. | Record the witness in `witnessRefs`, keep Bridge `kind`, `dir`, and `Loss` explicit, and keep scope capped until CL plus counterexamples justify promotion. |
| **AP‑XCTX‑10** | Two-way substitution by symmetry | “The Bridge is A↔B, so we can substitute both ways.” | `A↔B` expresses correspondence symmetry, not two substitution licences; substitution is directional and must be stated (F.9:13.2). | Declare both substitution directions explicitly, as two licences, two Bridges, or two editions, each with Loss plus counter-examples. |
| **AP‑XCTX‑11** | Kind and direction mismatch | `kind=⊒` but `dir=A→B` is used as if it licensed substitution. | Inverts narrower and broader; encourages unsafe “narrowing substitution” and silent information loss. | Swap endpoints (so the intended safe direction is written as `A→B` with `kind=⊑`), or declare an explicit inverse Bridge; keep scope ≤ Naming-only until the direction is justified. |
| **AP‑XCTX‑12** | Kernel promotion by Bridge | “Since A≈B, we can admit a unified global kind and treat both as instances.” | Bridges translate local senses; they do not admit new U-kinds. | If you need a new shared kind, follow E.24.UK and A.11; keep Bridges as translators between Context-local senses. |
| **AP‑XCTX‑13** | Edition drift or timeless equivalence | “A is equivalent to B” with no edition or as-of basis. | Makes the claim temporally incoherent as canons evolve; readers silently compare different revisions. | Pin editions via `Γ_time`; publish Bridge edits as new editions; fail-closed to Explanation-only when `Γ_time` cannot be stated. |
| **AP‑XCTX‑14** | Facet‑only alignment masquerading as whole‑cell sameness | “Customer corresponds to User” (but only `email` or an external ID aligns). | Collapses a partial lens into global sameness; invites unsafe substitution and row scope creep. | Refine endpoints to the facet SenseCells, or declare `facetSpan` explicitly and keep `scope` capped (usually Naming‑only). |
| **AP‑XCTX‑15** | Lexical translation ⇒ semantic identity | “Term A is the same as term B” as a translation or synonym. | Confuses labels with referents; erases loss and context. | Use `scope=Naming-only` with explicit `Loss`, including language and canon notes, and a counter-example; do not imply substitution. |
