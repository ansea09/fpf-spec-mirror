### A.6.S:11 - SoTA-Echoing

* **Adopt: algebraic effects and effect systems separate operation signatures from handler semantics.**
  Contemporary effect systems emphasise that an operation signature can be described independently of how effects are handled. A.6.S adopts the same separation at the signature‑engineering level: the SoI remains the conceptual boundary signature, while construction work and operational enforcement are handled elsewhere (mechanisms, realizations, work evidence). This echoes row‑typed algebraic effects and modern handler formulations (Leijen 2017; Hillerström & Lindley 2018).

* **Adapt: categorical optics treat “focus” and “round‑trip laws” as a disciplined interface for bidirectional structure.**
  Optics offer a compact mathematical language for “what is preserved” under a transformation and when updates are coherent. A.6.S adapts this mindset to boundary evolution: viewing corresponds to projection, and retargeting corresponds to an explicit transition with stated preservation claims. Profunctor optics provide a post‑2015 reference point for this style of interface reasoning (Pickering, Gibbons & Wu 2017).

* **Adapt: architecture description standards formalise `U.Viewpoint` and `U.View` responsibility and reduce semantic drift across representations.**
  ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 treats views as products of viewpoints, with explicit stakeholder concerns and responsibility. A.6.S adapts that discipline to signature publication: MVPK faces are explicit views derived from the SoI, and the ConstructorSignature makes “how we got this view” part of the signature-engineering trace (ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022).

* **Adopt in spirit: behavioural protocol disciplines treat boundaries as typed interaction protocols with safety commitments.**
  Session and behavioural type practice treats boundaries as protocols with progress and safety properties, which matches the A.6 split between signature laws and mechanism entry gates. A.6.S does not import tooling or typechecking, but it adopts the practice of making boundary interactions explicit and law‑governed (e.g., modern MPST practice as cited in A.6.1).
