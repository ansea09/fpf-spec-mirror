### F.0.1:8 - Anti‑patterns & remedies

| #       | Anti‑pattern (what goes wrong)   | Symptom in models                                          | Why harmful (conceptual)                            | Remedy (this pattern’s clause)                                                            |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A1**  | **Global term** (Contextless usage) | “process”, “service”, “role” used without a Context mark      | Meaning drifts; integration silently rewrites sense | **P‑S**: Always speak **term\@context**; qualify via section/table headers if repeated       |
| **A2**  | **String‑match identity**        | Equating *service* (ITIL) with *service* (web‑API) by name | String equality ≠ sense equality                    | **P‑B**: Cross‑context relations exist only as **Bridges** with `relation`+`CL`              |
| **A3**  | **senseFamily mixing in SenseCell**    | Local glosses include behaviours, deontics, equations      | Violates **Strict Distinction** (C‑6); blocks reuse | **P‑L**: SenseCell is **lexical only**; behaviour/deontic math belongs to FPF patterns   |
| **A4**  | **Edition blur**                 | Citing “BPMN” or “ITIL” without edition                    | Underspecified Context; un‑auditable sense shift       | **Context Card** carries `edition/year`; treat materially changed editions as distinct Contexts |
| **A5**  | **Context as type**              | Declaring “PROV‑O is‑a BPMN”                               | Implies inherited meanings between Contexts            | Contexts aren’t types; **no is‑a on Contexts** (E.10.D1). Use Bridges only                       |
| **A6**  | **Bridge without loss/fit**      | Bridge declared as “equivalent” with no assumptions        | Users infer total identity; trust calculus blind    | **P‑B**: Bridge must state `relation` and `CL`, plus a brief **loss/fit** note            |
| **A7**  | **Row from strings**             | Concept‑Set rows built from lexical forms                  | Homonyms/synonyms contaminate rows                  | Build rows from **SenseCells**; add only cells connected by acceptable Bridges (F.7)      |
| **A8**  | **Transitivity overreach**       | Chaining low-CL near-equivalences as if exact                | Inflates sameness; hides mismatch                   | **Bridge composition** (Sec. 10): compose with **min-CL** and keep the relation downgrade declared     |
| **A9**  | **Domain ≡ Context**                | “Domain” name used as if it were a `U.BoundedContext`      | Domain families are informal; Contexts are formal      | Keep **Domain family** informative on Context Cards; meanings bind to **Contexts** only         |
| **A10** | **Time‑stance confusion**        | Treating `design` and `run` senses as identical            | Crosses senseFamilies; erases execution/spec split         | Carry **time stance** on Context Cards; prefer `design‑spec‑of` / `run‑trace‑of` Bridges     |
