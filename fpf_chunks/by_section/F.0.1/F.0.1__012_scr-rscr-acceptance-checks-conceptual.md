### F.0.1:11 - SCR/RSCR acceptance checks (conceptual)

> *These checks are **content‑oriented**; they validate that a manuscript/model respects Part F principles. No process/tool assumptions are implied.*

#### F.0.1:11.1 - SCR — Static conformance

* **SCR‑F01 (Context‑qualified).** Every normative term is Context‑qualified (directly, or via a scoped header that unambiguously fixes the Context).
* **SCR‑F02 (Local cells).** Each SenseCell belongs to **exactly one** Context; no cell aggregates Cross‑context **senses**.
* **SCR‑F03 (senseFamily hygiene).** SenseCell glosses contain no behaviours/deontics/equations; those appear only in their patterns.
* **SCR‑F04 (Bridges explicit).** Every Cross‑context relation appears as a Bridge with `relation` and `CL` and a short **loss/fit** note.
* **SCR‑F05 (No string identity).** There is no use of string equality to stand in for Cross‑context identity.
* **SCR‑F06 (Time stance fidelity).** Where a Context fixes a `DesignRunTag`, the SenseCells and any Bridges reflect that stance explicitly.
* **SCR‑F07 (Row viability).** Any Concept‑Set row shown is supported by a connected subgraph of Bridges with **CL ≥ threshold** and no contradictions.

#### F.0.1:11.2 - RSCR — Regression & evolution

* **RSCR‑F01 (Edition split).** When a source edition changes materially, SenseCells tied to the old edition remain; new cells bind to the new Context; Bridges are re‑assessed.
* **RSCR‑F02 (Bridge stability).** If any Bridge endpoint changes gloss/stance, downgrade or retire the Bridge, documenting the **loss/fit** change.
* **RSCR‑F03 (Composition guard).** When composing Bridges in a chain, the resulting `CL` never exceeds the minimal link; relation `CL` drops monotonically.
* **RSCR‑F04 (Heterogeneity + QD guard):** requires ≥3 domain‑families AND MinInterFamilyDistance ≥ δ_family (per the active F1‑Card edition), with QD‑triad evidence (publish Diversity_P and IlluminationSummary on the declared grid/kernel). Near‑alias pairs (per dSig rule) SHALL be flagged and excluded or merged before the guard is evaluated. Record the F1‑Card edition id.

#### F.0.1:11.3 - Publish‑ready summary

An artefact is **ready** with respect to F.0.1 when:

1. **SCR‑F01…F07** hold for all terms, cells, rows, and bridges it presents;
2. **RSCR‑F01…F04** hold under simulated edition/stance changes;
3. Every Cross-context statement can be read as a **Bridge** or as a composition of Bridges with stated `CL` and relation loss.
