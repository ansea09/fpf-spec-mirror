### A.19.UINDM:5 - Archetypal Grounding (informative)

#### A.19.UINDM:5.1 - Tell

Think of UINDM as a **policy‑bound projection**:

* Input: “the declared characteristic basis for this exact bearer, claim scope and selected slices, qualification window, evidence basis, and intended use, plus an explicit indicator choice policy”
* Output: “the subset of characteristic references that are allowed to count as indicators for downstream CHR steps”

The key didactic boundary is: **UINDM chooses coordinates; it does not alter coordinates.**

#### A.19.UINDM:5.2 - Show (U.System) — cross‑unit engineering dashboard

A program manager maintains a `U.CharacteristicSpace` for manufacturing sites, including ~30 characteristics (quality, safety, cost, throughput, sustainability).

* The CN‑Spec’s `indicator_policy` for the “weekly executive dashboard” selects a subset:
  `{DefectRate, IncidentRate, UnitCost, LeadTime, EnergyPerUnit, OnTimeDelivery}`.
* UINDM runs `Indicatorize(...)` and outputs `IndicatorSetSlot =` those references.
* One site lacks reliable incident reporting for the last week. The indicator policy is evidence‑gated; `IndicatorizeEligibility` returns `degrade` (not `pass`), and the audit records the effective MinimalEvidence and the edition pins used.

Downstream mechanisms can now be held to the invariant: **they may only score/compare/select using the declared indicator profile (or explicitly abstain/degrade).** This avoids “dashboard drift” where different teams silently score on different subsets.

#### A.19.UINDM:5.3 - Show (U.Episteme) — robust evaluation across environments

A research lead wants indicators for model robustness under distribution shift (different hospitals, sensors, geographies).

* The declared characteristic-space basis includes many candidate metrics (accuracy slices, calibration, subgroup error, OOD detection quality).
* The indicator choice policy is “invariance‑driven”: prefer indicators whose semantics remain stable under environment changes; deprioritize proxy metrics known to be environment‑sensitive.
* UINDM returns an indicator set used by the scoring and comparison stages; uncertain indicators are handled via tri‑state guarding rather than coerced to zero or silently dropped.
