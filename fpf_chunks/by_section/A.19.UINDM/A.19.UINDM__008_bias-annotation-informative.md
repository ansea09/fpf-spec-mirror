### A.19.UINDM:6 - Bias-Annotation (informative)

* **Gov (governance).** Bias toward explicit policy surfaces (`IndicatorChoicePolicyRef`, edition pins, auditable outcomes) rather than tacit “expert choice.” Risk: perceived extra work. Mitigation: keep the mechanism minimal (selection‑only) and push method detail into wiring modules.

* **Arch (architecture).** Bias toward stable interfaces: SlotKind tokens come from the suite lexicon and evidence gates are explicit inputs. Risk: reduced “quick hacks.” Mitigation: allow `⊑⁺` extensions for richer outputs (e.g., justification) without mutating the kernel signature.

* **Onto/Epist.** Bias toward a strict distinction between “measurable characteristic” and “indicator under policy.” Risk: teams accustomed to “everything measurable is an indicator” may resist. Mitigation: embed this as an explicit LawSet clause (“No implicit NCV⇒indicator”).

* **Prag (pragmatics).** Bias toward fail‑closed guards and traceability under uncertainty. Risk: more `abstain/degrade` outcomes early. Mitigation: couple `degrade` with explicit downstream behaviors (policy‑bound) rather than silent coercions.

* **Did (didactics).** Bias toward “one place to learn the mechanism”: the problem/forces/solution narrative is co‑located with the canonical Mechanism.Intension.
