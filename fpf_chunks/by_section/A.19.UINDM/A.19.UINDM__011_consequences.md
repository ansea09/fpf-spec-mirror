### A.19.UINDM:9 - Consequences

**Benefits**

* Makes “which characteristics count as indicators” explicit, auditable, and policy‑bound.
* Prevents downstream semantic drift by freezing an indicator subset early in the CHR pipeline.
* Improves reproducibility via edition‑determinism (fixed editions ⇒ stable result).
* Preserves evolvability: new indicator selection method families can be added via wiring (packs/extensions) without changing the mechanism’s intension.

**Costs / trade‑offs**

* Adds an explicit step (and explicit policy work) before scoring/comparison.
* Strict fail‑closed behavior can increase early `degrade/abstain` outcomes until evidence and policies are properly specified.
