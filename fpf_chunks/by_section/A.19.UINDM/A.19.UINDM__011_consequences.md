### A.19.UINDM:9 - Consequences

**Benefits**

* Makes the selected indicator basis explicit, auditable and policy-bound, so downstream changes can be detected and assessed.
* Supports reproducibility under the complete fixed-input conditions of the edition-determinism law; edition labels alone are insufficient.
* Preserves evolvability: new indicator selection method families can be added via wiring (packs/extensions) without changing the mechanism’s intension.

**Costs / trade‑offs**

* Adds an explicit step (and explicit policy work) before scoring/comparison.
* Strict fail‑closed behavior can increase early `degrade/abstain` outcomes until evidence and policies are properly specified.
