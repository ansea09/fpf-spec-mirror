### A.19.SOURCE-SET-SPACE-SUBSTRATE:0.a - TERM/LEX token-status guard (local-first)

Keep this token-status split explicit:

- `CharacteristicSpace` is the reused `A.19` kind. This pattern does not mint a second space kind.
- `SearchSpaceRef` and `OutcomeSpaceRef` are role-named local fields whose slot content is typed by the existing `CharacteristicSpaceRef` / `SpaceRef` idiom. They are not new heads, not slot aliases inside the space, and not `U.Role` claims. In source-set/space-substrate or typed-set-view passages, read them as role-specific refinements of that older `SpaceRef` idiom rather than collapsing the roles back into one umbrella `SpaceRef`.
- `SpaceRefRelationKind` is a local relation-kind field over those two refs. In this slice, `sameDeclaredSpaceAs` and `distinctDeclaredSpaceFrom` are controlled token values for that field, not free prose.
- `SourceToOutcomeRelation` and `DistortionPosture` are local declaration fields. Their field names do not by themselves create one new generic ontology; the declaration requirement is satisfied only when their payload is explicit enough to audit.
- `SourceSetFamily`, `SourceSetComposition`, and `DerivedViewKind` are local fields in this `SourceSetSpaceSubstrate` declaration. Their use as fields does not establish a new object kind.
- `BasePaletteRef`, `OutcomeMapRef`, `SpaceMetricRef`, `TransitionRelationRef`, `BridgeDistortionNote`, `DescriptorMapRef`, and `DistanceDefRef` are guarded neighboring refs or interpretive qualifiers reused here. This pattern may cite them, but it does not redefine them.
- `carrier` inside `SourceToOutcomeRelation` identifies the relation definition, map, model or operation that supplies the connection. Its definition can be stated directly or cited where the reader can recover it. A containing paragraph merely expresses that definition; this field asserts no `U.PresentationCarrier` relation.
