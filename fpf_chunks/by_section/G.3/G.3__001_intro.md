## G.3 - CHR Authoring for a CG‑Frame: Characteristics, Scales, Levels, Coordinates

**Tag.** Architectural pattern (CHR kit; publishes lawful measurement primitives; constrains CAL authoring and selector/dispatch use)
**Stage.** *design‑time* (authoring & publication; enables admissible run-time consumption by `G.4` / `G.5`)
**Primary output.** `CHR Pack@CG‑Frame` — a notation‑independent, UTS‑published CHR bundle that provides: typed Characteristics/Scales/Levels/Coordinates, legality + guard surfaces, aggregation/comparison specs, RSCR hooks/tests, and provenance pins.
**Primary hooks.** `G.1` (declared CG-frame, which is the framing episteme), `G.2` (SoTA synthesis inputs), `A.19.CHR` (CHRMechanismSuite boundary + pins), `A.15.3` (SlotFillingsPlanItem baseline), `A.18/C.16` (MM-CHR legality), `F.0.1`, `F.1`, `F.9`, `F.17`, and `F.18` (source-local meaning, selected source editions, actual relations between local-sense cells, and bounded use and reliance), `B.3` / `B.3.4` (trust, freshness/decay), `A.10` (provenance anchors/carriers), `G.6` (EvidenceGraph/Path citation), optional `C.18 and C.19` (QD/OEE wiring), `G.11` (refresh orchestration).
**Non‑duplication note.** Universal Part‑G invariants (bridge‑only crossings, tri‑state semantics, penalties→`R_eff`‑only, set‑return semantics, P2W split, typed RSCR triggers + alias docking, defaults with one governing definition, linkage discipline) are governed by `G.Core`. This pattern cites them via `G.3:4.1` and delegates where needed.
