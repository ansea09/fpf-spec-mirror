### G.3:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ConformanceId     | Statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑G3‑CoreRef** | `G.3` is conformant only if the applicable `G.Core` obligations declared in `G.3:4.1` are satisfied (effective expansion of profiles/sets + deltas; explicit pins; typed RSCR triggers; defaults with one governing definition).                       |
| CC‑G3‑01          | `CHR Pack@CG‑Frame` is published as a notation‑independent kit payload with the minimum exported objects listed in `G.3:4.2`.                                                                                                         |
| CC‑G3‑02          | Every `CHR.Characteristic` has an explicit declared `Context`, an explicit `ReferencePlane`, and a filled `ObservableOf` field (instrument/protocol + uncertainty model + validity window).                                               |
| CC‑G3‑03          | Every `CHR.Characteristic` declares its `ScaleRef`, `Polarity`, and `UnitSet` (or an explicit “unitless” declaration), plus bounds/zero semantics where applicable.                                                                   |
| CC‑G3‑04          | Missingness is typed in the CHR artefacts such that downstream tri‑state handling is possible without silent coercion. *(Tri‑state semantics are governed by `G.Core`; the typing obligation is CHR‑local.)*                              |
| CC‑G3‑05          | `CHR.Scale` / `CHR.Level` artefacts encode the scale type and admissible transforms, and make illicit arithmetic checkable by downstream consumers.                                                                                   |
| CC‑G3‑06          | Any published `CHR.Coordinate` includes a `CoordinatePolicy` that states preserved invariants and explicit non‑entitlements; coordinates do not silently upgrade measurement structure.                                               |
| CC‑G3‑07          | `CHR.LegalityMatrix` and `CHR.Guards` exist and are referenced by downstream operator authoring; semantics are governed by cited definitions (MM‑CHR and `G.Core`), not duplicated locally.                                                        |
| CC‑G3‑08          | `CHR.AggregationSpecs` are typed and legality‑constrained; where Γ‑fold is required and no explicit override is pinned, cite `DefaultId.GammaFoldForR_eff` through `G.Core.DefaultGoverningDefinitionIndex`. |
| CC‑G3‑09          | If any characteristic is intended for promotion into `CG‑Spec`, the linkage is explicit and edition‑pinned (no shadow ids). *(Governing definition: `G.0`; wiring via `G.3:Ext.CGSpecPromotionWiring`.)*                                             |
| CC‑G3‑10          | UTS Name Cards exist for public ids minted or evolved by the CHR pack (twin labels plus public-id continuity notes). *(Delegation target: `CC‑GCORE‑UTS‑1` via `CC‑G3‑CoreRef`.)*                                                                      |
| CC‑G3‑11          | Worked examples and RSCR tests exist and cite `PathId/PathSliceId`; they cover illegal‑op refusal, unit and scale constraints, polarity invariants, and coordinate non‑entitlements.                                                      |
| CC‑G3‑12          | Thresholds/guard‑bands are not embedded in CHR artefacts; they remain governed by CAL acceptance clauses (`G.4`).                                                                                                                        |
| CC‑G3‑13          | When method‑role declarations are present (via `RoleDecls` and/or `QD.Role` alias), each declaration is **docked** to its governing pattern via a corresponding `G.3:Ext.*` module, and the edition and policy pins required by the governing pattern are surfaced to make downstream interpretation reproducible. *(QD/OEE governing patterns: `C.18` and `C.19`; wiring via `G.3:Ext.QD_OEE_Wiring`.)* |
| CC‑G3‑14          | **Evidence wired.** Each `CHR.Characteristic` links to R‑anchors via `PathId/PathSliceId` (and, where applicable, `A.10` anchor/carrier refs), so downstream evidence discipline (`G.6`) can audit legality and guard claims.            |
| CC‑G3‑15          | An `Archetypal Grounding` section exists with at least two domain‑distinct examples that demonstrate lawful CHR typing/legality and the CHR↔CAL separation (notably: no thresholds in CHR).                                          |
| CC‑G3‑16          | If `EvidenceLanes` are used, lane tags are declared with a citation to their governing pattern taxonomy (`B.3`), and any lane‑dependent tolerances/proof requirements are explicitly pinned (policy‑id / edition refs). Cross‑lane comparison/aggregation is **illegal by default** unless an explicit governing-pattern policy makes it lawful (typically `G.4`), and it must be auditable via evidence paths (`G.6`). |
| CC‑G3‑17          | If the CHR outputs are bound into the planned baseline / suite seam, the binding uses `CHRMechanismSuiteSlotFillingsPlanItem` as defined in `A.19.CHR` + `A.15.3` (no local baseline variants; wiring via `G.3:Ext.SuiteBoundaryLinkage`). |
| CC‑G3‑18          | **Freshness is explicit.** Each `CHR.Characteristic` declares a validity window and either (i) an explicit `NonDecayingDecl` or (ii) a freshness/half‑life statement that is pinned to the governing pattern (`B.3.4`) when policy‑bound (`G.3:Ext.DecayWiring`). Changes in decay windows/policies participate in RSCR via canonical trigger kinds declared in `G.3:4.1`. |
