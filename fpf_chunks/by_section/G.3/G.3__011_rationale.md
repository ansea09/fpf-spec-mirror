### G.3:10 - Rationale

CHR is the point where “numbers start moving” *only if* measurement semantics are stable enough to support lawful downstream reasoning. By making scale/unit/polarity explicit, publishing legality and guard surfaces, and requiring provenance pins, CHR authoring prevents downstream mechanisms from silently inventing their own legality assumptions.

Separating core invariants into `G.Core` prevents drift and ensures Part‑G‑wide properties (tri‑state, penalty routing, set‑return semantics, RSCR typing, Default Governing Definition Index) cite `G.Core` as their governing definition, while CHR remains responsible for CHR‑specific kit surfaces.
