### A.15.1:6 - Archetypal grounding (parallel domains)

#### A.15.1:6.1 - Surgical case (overlap and episodes)

* **Top run:** `Appendectomy_Case#2025‑08‑10T09:05–11:42`.
* **Method-description source:** `Appendectomy_v5`.
* **Performer:** `OR_Team_A#SurgicalTeamRole:Hospital_2025` (`U.RoleAssignment`).
* **Operational parts:** `Incision` (09:15–09:22), `Exploration` (overlaps with monitoring), `Closure` (11:10–11:35).
* **Episode:** brief power dip 10:02–10:07 → **resumptionOf** same run (per hospital policy).
* **Γ\_time:** union for OR utilization; hull for patient lead time.
* **Γ\_work:** totals consumables and staff time once (no double‑count for overlapping sub‑runs).

#### A.15.1:6.2 - ETL pipeline (parallelism and retries)

* **Top run:** `ETL_Nightly_2025‑08‑11T01:00–01:47`.
* **Method-description source:** `ETL_v12.bpmn`.
* **Performer:** `ETL_Runtime#TransformerRole:DataOps_2025`.
* **Parallel parts:** `Extract_A` ‖ `Extract_B`; `Transform` starts when either completes (overlap).
* **Retry:** `WarehouseWrite` failed at 01:36; retried with batch size ↓ — **new Work** linked via `retryOf`.
* **Γ\_time:** hull for SLA, union for cluster utilization.
* **Γ\_work:** sum compute minutes; attribute storage input and output once at the parent.

#### A.15.1:6.3 - Thermodynamic cycle (work as a state-space path)

* **Run:** `Carnot_Cycle_Run#2025‑08‑09T13:00–13:06`.
* **Method-description source:** `Carnot_Cycle_Spec` with Dynamics model.
* **Performer:** `LabRig_7#TransformerRole:ThermoLab`.
* **Work identity:** the **state-space path** traced during the interval; outputs: heat and work tallies. This path is a dynamics relation or geometry relation, not a work-control relation or ordered instruction sequence.
* **Γ\_time:** straightforward interval; **Γ\_work:** integrates energy exchange; no “steps” required.
