## A.15.1 - U.Work

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative

**At a glance.** Use `U.Work` when the current claim is a performed occurrence: dated work enacted by a holder under `U.RoleAssignment`, with its method, temporal extent, concrete bindings, used resources, affected referent, and containing system recoverable. Keep model use, actual change, entity-identity inception, evaluation, evidence, delivery, acceptance, and downstream effects under their own direct patterns.

**Use this when.** Use this pattern when a plan, method description, schedule, log, telemetry stream, dashboard, approval-looking cue, publication face, result statement, or evidence-provenance relation is being treated as if it were performed work. `U.Work` is the occurrence; surrounding records may identify, constrain, evidence, schedule, publish, or judge it, but they do not become the occurrence by being published.

**First useful result.** Identify one dated work occurrence and state only the facts needed by the current use: `performedBy -> U.RoleAssignment`, `enactsMethod -> U.Method`, temporal extent, `executedWithin`, concrete bindings, used resources, and affected referent. Add a method-description reference, model-use relation, actual-change claim, evaluation result, evidence relation, production claim, delivery, or acceptance relation only when that separately governed object is current.

**First-use checks.**
1. Name the candidate occurrence and the work-facing claim that depends on it.
2. Recover the `U.RoleAssignment`, enacted `U.Method`, temporal extent, accountable `U.System` or system in subsystem position, affected referent, concrete bindings, and used resources. Recover method-description, model-use, change, evaluation, evidence, production, delivery, or acceptance claims separately when current.
3. Decide whether the encountered record, trace, item, or display is performed `U.Work`, only a plan (`A.15.2`), only a method (`A.3.1`), only a method description (`A.3.2`), only evidence for work (`A.10`), only a publication-use relation (`E.17`), only a declarative representation (`C.2.P.DR` or the direct representation pattern), or an `A.15.4` appearance-based reliance repair case.
4. For composite, repeated, interrupted, or overlapping occurrences, declare the work-part relation, naming threshold, and aggregation policy before using totals or identity claims. Do not name a work part when a temporal relation, evidence slice, telemetry segment, or missing-source-relation note is the actual object needed.
5. If the required occurrence references cannot be recovered, lower the claim to a missing-source-relation note, work-evidence note, plan note, publication-use note, declarative-representation note, or `A.15.4` repair request; do not backdate work.

**Ordinary use.** For a simple occurrence, one readable assertion naming performer assignment, enacted method, temporal extent, affected referent, and used resources is enough.

**Reliance-bearing use.** Add only the exact neighboring claims on which cost, quality, audit, evidence, conformance, gate, release, measurement, model use, or aggregation currently depends; do not turn them into fields of the work occurrence.

**Stop condition.** Stop once the occurrence is either recoverable as `U.Work` at the needed granularity or lowered to a neighboring relation that no longer claims performed work.

**What goes wrong if missed.** Teams count plans, method descriptions, approval-looking cues, dashboards, telemetry, or evidence records as if work already happened, then attach cost, responsibility, quality, or result claims to the wrong EntityOfConcern.

**What this buys.** One dated occurrence identity whose performer assignment, enacted method, temporal extent, affected referent, bindings, and resource use remain inspectable while neighboring change, evaluation, evidence, production, delivery, and acceptance claims retain their own identities and governors.

**Not this pattern when.** Not this pattern when the current claim is only a method (`A.3.1`), only a method description (`A.3.2`), only a plan or schedule (`A.15.2`), only a `SlotFillingsPlanItem` (`A.15.3`), only work-entry readiness or full-kit preparation before work entry (`A.15.5`), only a visible cue that needs `A.15.4` appearance-based reliance repair before reliance, only evidence or assurance (`A.10` or `B.3`), only publication-use behavior (`E.17`), or only a declarative representation overread as a work-control or method claim (`C.2.P.DR` or the direct representation pattern).
