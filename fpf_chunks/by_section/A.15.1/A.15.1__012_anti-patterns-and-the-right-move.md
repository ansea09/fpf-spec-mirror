### A.15.1:11 - Anti‑patterns (and the right move)

* **“The log is the process.”** Dumping telemetry without binding (spec, performer, context) → **Not Work**. Create a Work, link the log as evidence.
* **Record‑only transforms.** ETL/replication of records with no declared affected referent (product/dataset as product) → **Not Work** in this context; either declare the dataset as the product referent or move it to `U.WorkPlan`/operations‑support.
* **Silent cross‑context acceptance.** “Ops accepted it, so audit accepts it.” → Add a **Bridge** or re‑judge in audit context.
* **Spec drift in mid‑run.** Swapping SOP v5→v6 without recording → Split into episodes or record override.
* **Budget on the method.** Charging costs to Method or Role → Book **only** to Work; keep estimates in specs.
* **Part ambiguity.** Mixing retries, episodes, and operational parts with no declared relation → Choose and declare the part relation.
* **Union/hull confusion.** Changing KPI coverage silently between reports → Declare `Γ_time` policy per KPI.
* **Double‑count in overlaps.** Summing child and parent resource ledgers → Declare and apply an overlap policy.
