### C.23:2 - Problem

Unstructured “readiness” stories and undisciplined evidence lead to:

* (i) **Illicit scalarisation** across mixed scale types,
* (ii) **Prose‑only** gating that a dispatcher cannot execute,
* (iii) Cross‑Context reuse without Bridges/CL, and
* (iv) Immature families leaking into production.
  We need a **notation‑independent LOG layer** that turns **TaskSignature (S2)** + **EvidenceProfiles** into **executable rules** for *admit / degrade / abstain*, **routing any CL penalties to `R_eff` only** (never mutating **F/G**).
