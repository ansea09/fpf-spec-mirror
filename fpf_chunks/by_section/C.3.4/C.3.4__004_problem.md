### C.3.4:3 - Problem

1. **Kind sprawl.** Teams mint near‑duplicate kinds (“Account\_PCI”, “Account\_Ledger”), and alignment decays.
2. **Hidden constraints.** Informal “we only accept …” statements leak into prose; guards can’t check them deterministically.
3. **Scope conflation.** Contextual requirements (jurisdiction, API version) get smuggled into “type” talk, blurring Scope vs Kind.
4. **Cross‑context fragility.** Masks don’t travel unless their constraints are mapped; teams reuse names and hope.
