### C.3.4:6 - Norms & Invariants (normative)

> The following formalize and expand **RM‑01…RM‑08** referenced in C.3.

#### C.3.4:6.1 - Definition & Shape

**RM‑01 (Definition).** `U.RoleMask(kind, Context)` **SHALL** be a named, versioned record with:
(a) **intent** (what role/procedure the mask serves),
(b) **constraints** (entity‑level predicates; optional context requirements),
(c) **vocabulary/notation bindings**,
(d) **membership narrowing** definition (if any),
(e) **intended guard use**.

**RM‑02 (Not a new kind).** A RoleMask **MUST NOT** introduce a new `U.Kind`. If the domain needs a stable refinement, Contexts **SHALL** publish an explicit `SubkindOf` node (C.3.1).

**RM‑03 (Determinism).** Membership under a mask (if defined) **MUST** be **deterministic** given `slice` and published constraints; implicit “latest” is forbidden.

**RM‑04 (Mask taxonomy).** A mask **SHALL** declare its type: **constraint / vocabulary / composite**.
— **Vocabulary masks** MUST NOT change membership;
— **Constraint/composite masks** MAY narrow membership **only via entity‑level predicates**.

#### C.3.4:6.2 - Separation of channels

**RM‑05 (Context vs entity).**

* Predicates about **entities** (features, attributes) MAY narrow membership: `Extension_mask(k, s) ⊆ Extension(k, s)`.
* Predicates about **ContextSlice** (jurisdiction, Standards, Γ\_time) **SHALL** be enforced via **USM Scope** guards (A.2.6). Masks **MUST NOT** hide Scope requirements inside membership checks.

**Guard routing.** Enforce ContextSlice predicates via **USM Scope** (A.2.6) and entity predicates via **membership**; see **Annex C.3.A §4.3 (Guard_MaskedUse)** and **§5 (E‑01)** for the normative order of checks.

**RM‑06 (Guard use).** Guards **MAY** reference a RoleMask by name **only** if the mask is **registered, versioned, and its constraints are observable** at guard time. Mask names **MUST NOT** be treated as kind synonyms.

#### C.3.4:6.3 - Promotion & Catalog

**RM‑07 (Promotion rule).** A constraint mask reused broadly and stably **SHOULD** be promoted to an explicit **subkind** with a `⊑` link; retire the mask or keep it as a vocabulary wrapper. Editors **SHALL** track promotions in the catalog.

**RM‑08 (Catalog).** Contexts **SHALL** catalog masks (name, version, type, intent, constraints, bindings, examples, related subkinds, known bridges/adapters). Redundant masks **SHOULD** be consolidated.

#### C.3.4:6.4 - Cross‑context use

**RM‑09 (Bridges & adapters).** If a claim uses `MemberOf(–, RoleMask(k), TargetSlice)` across Contexts, the receiving Context **SHALL** require:
(a) a **KindBridge** for `k` (`CLᵏ`, loss notes), and
(b) a **MaskAdapter** — a documented, deterministic mapping of the mask’s **entity‑level constraints** and **vocabulary bindings** into the target Context — whenever those constraints/bindings differ.
Penalties **MUST** route to **R**: `Ψ(CLᵏ)` for kind, plus any **Φ(CL)** for scope bridge.

**RM‑10 (Definedness & fail‑closed).** Mask evaluation **SHALL** state its definedness area; outside it, guards **fail closed**.
