### C.3.4:4 - Forces

| Force | Tension to resolve |
| --- | --- |
| Local specialization vs common core | A use needs tailoring without forking the base kind. |
| Expressivity vs determinism | Real constraints must remain reproducibly checkable. |
| Applicability vs uncertainty | Candidate/slice mismatch stops before the judgment; missing facts preserve `unknown`. |
| Scope vs candidate constraints | Conditions on ClaimScope stay under A.2.6; conditions on the candidate enter classification. |
| Reuse vs proliferation | Stable conceptual distinctions may warrant a separately identified kind, but declaration reuse alone does not. |
| Locality vs identity | A changed locality prompts comparison of membership distinctions, not automatic bridging. |
