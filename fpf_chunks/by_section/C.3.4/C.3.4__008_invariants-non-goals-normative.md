### C.3.4:7 - Invariants & Non‑goals (normative)

* **No Scope leakage.** RoleMasks **cannot** widen/narrow **Claim scope (G)**; any context conditions are enforced by USM guards.
* **Identity preservation.** The carrier kind remains `k`; RoleMask does not change entityOfConcern.
* **Weakest‑link unaffected.** RoleMasks do not alter weakest‑link rules on **F/R**; guards **route entity predicates to membership** and **context predicates to USM Scope**.
