### C.3.4:7 - Invariants & Non‑goals (normative)

* **No Scope leakage.** RoleMasks **cannot** widen/narrow **Claim scope (G)**; any context conditions are enforced by USM guards.
* **Identity preservation.** The carrier kind remains `k`; RoleMask does not change entityOfConcern.
* **Weakest-link unaffected.** RoleMask declarations do not alter weakest-link rules on F/R; guards route candidate-feature predicates to the exact masked judgment and context predicates to USM Scope.
