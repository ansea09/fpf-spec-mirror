### G.4:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

* **Hidden thresholds.**
  Avoid: embedding cutoffs in CHR prose or in operator descriptions.
  Prefer: `CAL.AcceptanceClause` with explicit ids and pins.

* **Untyped “score(x)”.**
  Avoid: operators with implicit units and untracked legality assumptions.
  Prefer: explicit CHR‑typed operator signatures + cited legality checks.

* **Silent cross‑context reuse.**
  Avoid: importing constructs across Contexts/planes/editions without published crossings.
  Prefer: explicit crossing artifacts and citations; keep CAL pack Context‑local.

* **Acceptance as implementation detail.**
  Avoid: acceptance embedded in tool logic.
  Prefer: publish acceptance as citable CAL artifacts; downstream consumes ids.

* **Exploratory telemetry treated as dominance.**
  Avoid: letting probe/illumination telemetry quietly become a dispatch criterion.
  Prefer: keep it report‑only unless an explicit policy‑bound acceptance clause authorizes promotion.
