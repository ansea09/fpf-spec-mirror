### A.6.4:7 - Rationale & SoTA‑echoing  *(informative)*
* **Fibrations and base‑change (displayed categories, 2017+).**
  With epistemes forming a category `Ep` fibred over `Ref` via `α : Ep → Ref` (C.2 / A.6.2), EpistemicViewing corresponds to **vertical morphisms** (`α(v) = id`), while EpistemicRetargeting corresponds to **reindexing along base arrows** (`α(r) = b : R₁→R₂`). This lines up with base‑change and transport along fibrations in category theory.

* **Structured cospans and reinterpretation.**
  Modern work on structured cospans and open systems uses cospans and their morphisms to move between different presentations of a system while preserving a notion of interface/behaviour. Retargeting plays a similar role: it moves from one entity kind to another while preserving a declared invariant.

* **Fourier‑style dualities.**
  In signal processing and physics, Fourier and related transforms are often treated as isometries between function spaces, preserving energy while changing the domain of discourse. `U.EpistemicRetargeting` abstracts this pattern: the invariant is codified in KD‑CAL/LOG‑CAL; the morphism explicitly changes the described entity along a `KindBridge`.

* **Data/model duality in ML.**
  Contemporary ML workflows cycle between data and models; invariants such as likelihood, risk, and calibration matter more than raw equality of ClaimGraphs. Retargeting gives a structured way to talk about data→model (and, potentially, model→data) moves as episteme morphisms, rather than untyped “training” steps.

* **Consistency management and abstraction.**
  In model‑driven and bidirectional transformation literature, abstraction and refinement transfers information between models with different subject domains. Treating these as retargetings with explicit Bridges and invariants makes their assumptions amenable to CL accounting and KD‑CAL reasoning, instead of hiding them in tooling.
