### A.6.4:2 - Problem

Without a dedicated pattern for EpistemicRetargeting:
1. **Retargeting is silently confused with viewing.**
   Structural reinterpretations (e.g., component→function, signal→spectrum, data→model) can be mistakenly treated as “just another view” of the same entity, even though they change `describedEntityRef`. This hides the fact that the **described entity** has changed and that a `KindBridge` and invariant are required.

2. **Invariants float untyped.**
   Fourier‑style moves, structural reinterpretations, and abstraction/refinement steps are often justified by “energy is preserved”, “this component realises that function”, or “this model summarises those data” — but these invariants are not connected to the episteme morphism class. Without a dedicated species:

   * invariants live only in text,
   * CL‑penalties and ReferencePlane crossings cannot be tracked systematically (Part F).

3. **Cross‑kind reasoning has no canonical morphism.**
   A general EFEM (A.6.2) can change `describedEntityRef` by setting `describedEntityChangeMode = retarget`, but:

   * nothing states what that means at the level of kinds (`Kind(describedEntityRef(X))` vs `Kind(describedEntityRef(Y))`),
   * nothing connects these moves to `KindBridge` and ReferencePlane policies.

4. **StructuralReinterpretation is ad‑hoc.**
   E.TGA treats StructuralReinterpretation as a graph node, but its semantics are much closer to a generic “retargeting under a bridge” pattern than to something specific to graph‑based architectures. Without a core pattern:

   * StructuralReinterpretation risks duplicating retargeting logic,
   * other discipline packs may reinvent their own ad‑hoc re‑targetings.

5. **I/D/S discipline is left underspecified.**
   For descriptions/specifications (`…Description` / `…Spec`), retargeting **changes `DescribedEntityRef` in `DescriptionContext = ⟨DescribedEntityRef, BoundedContextRef, ViewpointRef⟩`** (E.10.D2), but must say what happens to context and viewpoint. Without an explicit pattern, these decisions get scattered across different E‑patterns instead of being governed centrally.
