### A.19.UNM:2 - Problem

Without an explicit UNM governing pattern:

1) **Normalization drifts into hidden places.** It gets embedded inside scoring, comparison, or selection, making admissibility and governance non-local.

2) **Comparability becomes rhetorical.** People say “we normalize” but cannot answer:
   *Which method? Which invariants? Which bearer, comparison basis, scope and window? Which evidence? Does the receiving comparison rely on an actual Bridge, kind relation, or plane relation?*

3) **Basis and relation changes become invisible.** Teams reuse normalizations for another bearer, comparison basis, source-local meaning, or reference plane without naming what changed or the relation on which the new use depends.

4) **Engineers cannot reconstruct the operation.** Scattered definitions can hide its inputs, result, preservation conditions or limits, preventing a justified reuse.
