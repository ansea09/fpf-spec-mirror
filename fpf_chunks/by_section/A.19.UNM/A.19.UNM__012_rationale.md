### A.19.UNM:10 - Rationale

UNM is designed as a **minimal canonical semantic surface**:
- Enough structure to prevent illegal comparisons and hidden transformations.
- Explicit routing in CN-frame so normalization is governance, not an algorithmic trick.
- Evidence/calibration are delegated to MM‑CHR to avoid redefining measurement meaning.
- Exact bearer, basis, scope/window and intended-use checks prevent accidental global normalization; actual Bridge, kind, and plane relations are cited only when a conclusion relies on them.

This balances evolvability (methods evolve) with didactic usability (one place to read what UNM is).
