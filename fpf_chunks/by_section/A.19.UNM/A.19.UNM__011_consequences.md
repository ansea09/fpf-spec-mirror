### A.19.UNM:9 - Consequences

**Benefits**
- Makes “normalize-then-compare” a first-class governance choice.
- Centralizes governing-pattern assignment, improving usability and reducing drift.
- Supports evolvability: method families can evolve via packs/extensions without mutating the mechanism surface.
- Makes known admission failures explicit through the declared guard result; correctness still depends on the grounds used by the evaluation.

**Costs**
- Requires explicit declarations (method instance, invariants, validity window, evidence pins).
- Class-level use requires compatibility/query arguments; ordinary transformed-value use need not construct a quotient or fix.
