### A.19.UNM:9 - Consequences

**Benefits**
- Makes “normalize-then-compare” a first-class governance choice.
- Centralizes governing-pattern assignment, improving usability and reducing drift.
- Supports evolvability: method families can evolve via packs/extensions without mutating the mechanism surface.
- Prevents silent illegality (unit, scale, and plane errors) by fail-closed guards.

**Costs**
- Requires explicit declarations (method instance, invariants, validity window, evidence pins).
- Some workflows must learn quotient/fix thinking (a conceptual overhead).
