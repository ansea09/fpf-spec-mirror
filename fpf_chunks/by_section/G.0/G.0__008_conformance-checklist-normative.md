### G.0:7 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ConformanceId | Statement |
| --- | --- |
| **CC‑G0‑CoreRef** | `G.0` is conformant only if the applicable core obligations listed in `G.0:4.1` are satisfied (delegation to `CC‑GCORE‑*`; no shadow specs, no competing defaults, typed RSCR triggers, explicit pins). |
| CC‑G0‑01 | `CG‑Spec` is published as a notation-independent UTS object with explicit `Edition`, `Context`, `Scope`, `describedEntity`, and a minimum `ReferenceMap`. |
| CC‑G0‑02 | `CNSpecRef.edition` is present and is treated as an external governance-card reference (no local redefinition of CN semantics). *(Delegation target: `CC‑GCORE‑CN‑CG‑1`.)* |
| CC‑G0‑03 | `ComparatorSet` is explicit and finite; each comparator is typed and bound to `SCP` and referenced CHR characteristics; **anything not enumerated MUST be treated as illegal/abstain by default** (no implicit comparator defaults). |
| CC‑G0‑04 | `SCP` declares, per characteristic, the lawful operation regime needed for each referenced comparator (scale/unit/polarity constraints and any required proofs/refs). |
| CC‑G0‑05 | `MinimalEvidence` is declared per characteristic and includes explicit lane/carrier requirements, freshness window references (if any), and explicit failure behavior wiring (tri-state semantics delegated). If freshness windows are used, a stable window id (e.g., `PathSliceId`) MUST be pinned for audit. |
| CC‑G0‑06 | `Γ‑fold` is present as an edition-pinned segment and either (i) cites `DefaultId.GammaFoldForR_eff` (one governing definition) or (ii) provides an explicit override with proof refs. |
| CC‑G0‑07 | If crossing penalties are used, `CL‑Routing` and `Φ` policy ids are explicit and auditable (policy ids are exposed as pins/refs) **and are required pins for downstream SCR publication on penalised claims** (see `G.6`). |
| CC‑G0‑08 | `AcceptanceStubs` in `CG‑Spec` are templates only; any context-local thresholds/acceptance policies are governed by CAL acceptance artefacts (G.4) and are cited, not duplicated. |
| CC‑G0‑09 | RSCR tests and triggers for edits to legality surfaces and evidence minima are present and use canonical `RSCRTriggerKindId`s. The RSCR test set SHOULD cover at least: illegal_op_refusals; unit and scale legality checks; freshness windows; partial-order scalarisation refusals; threshold semantics; CL→`R_eff` routing; refusal of `degrade.order` on unit mismatches (MM‑CHR). |
| CC‑G0‑10 | `PublicIdContinuity` is declared: governing definition, DRR link, refresh cadence, decay and aging policy, and deprecations. Deprecations preserve lexical continuity (Δ-discipline; delegated to `CC‑GCORE‑ID‑*`). |
| CC‑G0‑11 | *(Conditional)* If `Illumination` / QD hooks are present, `DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, and any `InsertionPolicyRef` / promotion policy ids are pinned (or explicitly marked absent) and are recorded in provenance/audit pins. |
| CC‑G0‑12 | *(Conditional)* If freshness windows influence gating/selection, they are published and enforced, and the relevant window ids (`PathSliceId` or equivalent) are recorded in SCR/audit pins. |
| CC‑G0‑13 | **Pre-flight numeric gates.** Any numeric comparison/aggregation declared in `ComparatorSet` has associated `GateChecks` for unit legality, scale legality, pinned SOP/editions, and declared comparability assumptions; failing any check yields `refuse` or `abstain` (tri-state semantics delegated). |
| CC‑G0‑14 | **GateCrossing hook exposure.** Exports provide `Expose_CrossingHooks` inputs so `GateChecks` (`E.18/A.21`) can validate plane consistency, crossing intent, lane purity, and lexical SD; failures MUST block publication. |
| **CC‑G0‑Φ** | `Φ(CL)` (and `Φ_plane`, if used) is monotone, bounded, and table-backed; policy ids are published; construction preserves `R_eff ≥ 0`. |
| **CC‑G0‑Unknowns** | *Delegated.* Unknown handling MUST follow the tri-state guard semantics `{pass|degrade|abstain}` with no silent coercions. (See `CC‑GCORE‑GUARD‑1`.) |
| **CC‑G0‑CSLC** | Scale/unit/polarity legality MUST be proven before any aggregation; illegal arithmetic on ordinal/nominal values is nonconformant. (Governed by the relevant legality patterns; `G.0` only binds and cites.) |
