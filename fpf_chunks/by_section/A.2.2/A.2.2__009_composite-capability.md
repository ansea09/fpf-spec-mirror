### A.2.2:8 - Composite Capability

A composite system may have a capability that none of its parts has alone. Treat the composite as the holder.

```text
Capability:
  holder: Cell_3
  canDo: place 12 PCB per minute
  envelope: feeder, vision, head, controller, and operator conditions
  measures: placement tolerance, throughput, fault rate
  qualificationWindow: current configuration and calibration window
  dependencyNotes: feeder and vision subsystem conditions
```

The capability belongs to `Cell_3`, not to every part and not to the method description. Dependencies may be named, but the whole-system capability remains a property of the composite holder.
