### A.2.2:3 - Positive Solution

Use `U.Capability` when the object under discussion is the holder's ability to achieve a result class within a declared envelope and measure set.

Minimal capability statement:

```text
CapabilityStatement:
  holder: U.System
  canDo: WorkFamilyOrResultClass
  envelope: CapabilityEnvelope
  measures: CapabilityMeasureSet
  qualificationWindow: QualificationWindow
  evidenceOrSourceUse: EvidenceOrSourceUseRefs
```

Plain sentence form:

```text
<System> can perform <work family or result class>
within <envelope>
at <measures>
during <qualification window>,
with <evidence or source-use relation>.
```

This form is deliberately not a method description. It does not list the step order or algorithm. It also does not assign the holder to a role or assert that a work occurrence happened.
