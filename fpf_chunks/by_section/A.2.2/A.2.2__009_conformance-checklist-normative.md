### A.2.2:8 - Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A2.2‑1 (Holder type).**
A capability **belongs to** a **`U.System`** (physical, cyber, socio‑technical, or organizational). Capabilities are **not** assigned to `U.Episteme`.

**CC‑A2.2‑2 (Separation of concerns).**
A capability is **not** a Role, **not** a Method or MethodDescription, **not** a Work, and **not** a promise content clause (`U.PromiseContent`). Models **SHALL NOT** use capability declarations to stand in for assignments, recipes, executions, or promises.

**CC‑A2.2‑3 (WorkScope required for operational use).**
When a capability is used to qualify a step or to support planning, its statement **MUST** name a **WorkScope** (conditions/assumptions) and **WorkMeasures** (targets/ranges). **Guards that admit Work MUST test** that the **holder’s WorkScope covers the step’s JobSlice** (i.e., `WorkScope ⊇ JobSlice`) **and that WorkMeasures meet the step’s thresholds, with an explicit `Γ_time` window bound**. Without a WorkScope and measures, a capability is advisory and **SHALL NOT** be used for step admission or assurance claims.

**CC‑A2.2‑4 (Context anchor).**
Capability statements that drive operational decisions **MUST** be anchored to a **`U.BoundedContext`** (the “Context” whose vocabulary and test norms apply).

**CC‑A2.2‑5 (QualificationWindow).**
When capabilities are used operationally (e.g., to gate Work), the statement **MUST** carry a **QualificationWindow** (calibration window, software version window, etc.) and the guard **MUST name the `Γ_time` window** used for the check. Outside the QualificationWindow, the claim is not admissible for gating.

**CC‑A2.2‑6 (Past work remains past).**
Updates to a capability statement **SHALL NOT** retroactively invalidate already recorded Work. Past Work is judged against the capability declaration that was valid **at the time of execution**.

**CC‑A2.2‑7 (Threshold checks are orthogonal to roles).**
A step that requires both a Role and a capability threshold admits a Work only if **both** are satisfied: (i) the performer’s **Role assignment** is active in the step window; (ii) the **holder’s capability** meets or exceeds the threshold **with `WorkScope ⊇ JobSlice` and within the **QualificationWindow** at the named **`Γ_time`**.**

**CC‑A2.2‑8 (Derived capabilities).**
If a capability is claimed for a **composite system** (assembled by Γ), the claim **MUST** be stated as a property of that composite holder (not of its parts) with clear dependency notes (e.g., “valid while Subsystem B meets X”). Details of derivation belong to the context’s methodology, not to this definition.

**CC‑A2.2‑9 (No capability for epistemes).**
Algorithms, standards, and documents provide **evidence** or **recipes**; they **do not** “have capability.” Only systems do.

**CC-A2.2-10 (`Γ_time` selector in guards).**
Scope-sensitive guards (including Method–Work gates) **MUST** include an explicit **`Γ_time`** selector indicating the window *W* over which **ScopeCoverage** and **WorkMeasures** are evaluated.
