### A.2.2:6 - Archetypal grounding (parallel structural and organizational examples)

#### A.2.2:6.1 Physical system on a line (structural example)

* **Holder:** `RobotArm_A` (`U.System`).
* **Task family:** seam welding per `Weld_MIG_v3` **MethodDescription**.
* **WorkScope:** workpiece steel grades S235–S355; ambient 18–30 °C; argon mix 92–95 %; torch T‑MIG‑07.
* **Measures:** bead width 6.0 mm ± 0.2 mm; throughput ≤ 12 seams/min; defect rate < 0.5 %.
* **Context:** `AssemblyLine_2025`.
* **Readable claim:** *RobotArm\_A can execute Weld\_MIG\_v3 within the stated **WorkScope** at the stated measures (AssemblyLine\_2025).*
* **What this is not:** It is **not** “the welder”—that is a **Role assignment** when assigned on a shift. It is **not** the weld recipe— that is the **MethodDescription**.

#### A.2.2:6.2 Software service in operations (structural, cyber-physical)

* **Holder:** `PlannerService_v4` (deployed system).
* **Task family:** job‑shop schedule generation per `JS_Schedule_v4` MethodDescription.
* **WorkScope:** 50–500 jobs; 5–40 machines; hard deadlines only; network latency ≤ 20 ms.
* **Measures:** schedule completion within 0.95 of theoretical optimum (benchmark set), 98 % on‑time delivery in simulation.
* **Context:** `PlantScheduling_2025`.
* **Use:** Steps that “require ScheduleGeneration capability ≥ 0.90 optimality” will only pass if the holder’s capability meets or exceeds that bound.

#### A.2.2:6.3 Organizational unit (enterprise sense)

* **Holder:** `FinanceDept` (`U.System` as OrgUnit).
* **Task family:** period close per `CloseBooks_v3` MethodDescription.
* **WorkScope:** IFRS; ERP v12; 8 legal entities; staffing ≥ 6 FTE; cut‑off rules X.
* **Measures:** close in ≤ 5 business days; adjustment error rate < 0.2 %.
* **Context:** `OperatingModel_2025`.
* **Distinction:** This is **ability**; the **service promise clause** “Provide month‑end close” is the external promise derived from this ability once formally offered.
