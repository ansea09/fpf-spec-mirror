### A.19.USCM:10 - Rationale

Scoring is a frequent source of semantic precision loss: it is easy to smuggle normalization, illegal arithmetic, implicit thresholds, and uncertainty coercion into “a simple scoring function.” USCM prevents that by forcing a clean boundary:

* **Admissibility first:** all transforms are justified by `CG‑Spec.SCP` and CSLC.
* **No hidden steps:** normalization is explicit (UNM), aggregation is explicit (ULSAM), ordering is explicit (CPM/SelectorMechanism).
* **Uncertainty is visible:** admissibility is tri‑state; unknown is not coerced.
* **Audit is minimal yet decisive:** effective editions and effective evidence policy are always traceable.

This increases both evolvability (stable interface, externalized method semantics) and didactic usability (a single place to learn USCM’s boundary and obligations).
