### A.19.USCM:0 - At a glance — didactic, informative

* **Suite stage:** `score` (ordering lives only in `A.19.CHR:4.5` / `suite_protocols`; suite membership is a set in `A.19.CHR:4.2`).
* **Inputs, conceptual:** an admitted measure profile (`InputProfileSlot`) + `CNSpecRef` + `CGSpecRef` + `ScoringMethodDescriptionRef` + active `U.BoundedContextRef`, with optional `MinimalEvidenceRef` override.
* **Output:** `ScoreProfileSlot` = a set of score measures (vector scores are first‑class; a scalar score is allowed only if explicitly declared).
* **Non‑goals:** does **not** normalize (UNM), aggregate (ULSAM), compare (CPM), select (SelectorMechanism), threshold, publish, or emit telemetry; it is a scoring step with explicit admissibility and evidence surfaces.
* **P2W seam:** concrete edition/policy pin bindings (including `ScoringMethodDescriptionRef@edition(…)` when USCM is used) are chosen in planned baseline plan items (`A.15.3` + `A.19.CHR:4.7.2`); executions only record effective refs/pins in `Audit`.
* **Failure mode:** tri‑state guard (`pass|degrade|abstain`); unknown never coerces to `pass`, and MUST NOT be coerced to `0/false`.
* **Quick rule of thumb:** if `CGSpecSlot.SCP` is missing → `ScoreEligibility = abstain` (fail‑closed); if `ScoringMethodDescriptionSlot` is missing → `ScoreEligibility = abstain` (no implicit scoring method); if `CN‑Spec.comparability` requires normalization‑based comparability → normalization MUST be explicit in choreography (Uses/pins), never hidden inside `Score`.
