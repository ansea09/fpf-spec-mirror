### F.1:7 - What to record (conceptual, not clerical)

**7.1 The two‑minute memory.**
Everything you need to *think correctly later* fits on an eight‑line card. No registries, no workflows, no storage choices.

**7.2 The Context Card (one‑screen sketch).**
*(Each bullet is a thought, not a field.)*

* **Name & edition.** *“BPMN 2.0 (2011)”* • *“W3C PROV‑O (2013)”* • *“ITIL 4 (2020)”*.
* **Domain family.** *workflow* / *provenance* / *services* / *deontics* / *sensing* / *types* / *control* … *(informative only; never used to infer meaning).*
* **Scope gist** *(didactic; ≠ `USM.ScopeSlice(G)`)*. One line that marks the **inside/outside** (“workflow **graphs & participants**”, “provenance **entities/activities/agents**”).
* **Time stance** *(if inherent)*. Does the canon speak **design** (specifications, models) or **run** (occurrences, acts)?
* **Lexical trip‑wires.** Known homonyms or false friends in this Context (*“process ≠ thermodynamic process”*, *“role (RBAC) ≠ behavioural role”*).
* **Neighbour Contexts** *(informative)*. Close cousins that people often conflate (*BPMN ↔ PROV‑O*, *ITIL ↔ ODRL*).
* **Recency note.** *Current* / *superseded* / *candidate* (only as a reminder to yourself which text you mean).
* **Why this Context matters here.** One sentence linking to your unification line (“we will name Executions later; PROV‑O keeps them run‑time”).
* **Diversity signature (dSig).** A 5-characteristics discrete signature for `U.BoundedContext`: **[Sector, Function, Archetype, Regime, MetricFamily]**. Authors SHOULD pick from local discipline taxonomies. **Publish a `dSigSource` list (five refs/URIs, one per characteristic) on every Card**, falling back to free-text only where no canonical term exists. Two Contexts are flagged as **Near-Duplicate** when ≥3 characteristics match. Publish `dSig` and `dSigSource` on every Card.

> *If your Card spills beyond a screen, you are collecting facts, not fixing meaning.*

F1‑Card (normative artefact): { taxonomyRef, embeddingRef, DistanceDef, δ_family, confidenceBand, calibrationSet, edition, subFamilyDef? }. subFamilyDef (optional): declares the stable partitioning below a domain‑family (e.g., taxonomic sub‑fields or CVT clusters with parent family anchors).  When HET‑FIRST quotas refer to “sub‑family”, they MUST use this declared subFamilyDef.
Declare **DomainDistance** policy (cosine or transport) and δ_family threshold; version as part of DescriptorMapRef. Publish `confidenceBand` (e.g., CI90%) for the calibrated `δ_family`; treat numbers in examples as illustrative, not normative.
