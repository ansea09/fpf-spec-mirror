### E.4:4 - Solution

Describe an FPF-grounded pattern ecosystem as a family of framework editions and publication/access carriers over selected structures. For every claim, state the exact subject and relation and cite the defining or constraining ClaimGraph in its subject pattern. A principle framework edition is not merely a bundle of documents, an ontology catalogue, a literature survey, or a guide to talking about a domain. Its pattern language renders a selected architecture of recurring problem situations, forces, known failure modes, reusable SoTA solution moves, consequences, cases, relation records, evaluation methods, and refresh conditions for a declared reader and use. Known failure modes include beginner mistakes and experienced-practitioner failures caused by stale, local-only, or non-SoTA practice.

Create a family-and-structure map with these fields:

```text
FPFFamilyAndStructureMap@Context:
  ecosystemScopeRef
  boundedContextRef
  frameworkFamilyMembers
  selectedPatternSetRefs
  selectedProblemSituationStructureRefs
  selectedKnownFailureModeRefs
  selectedSoTASolutionMoveRefs
  selectedSolutionMoveStructureRefs
  selectedRelationRecordRefs
  frameworkCarrierRenderingRefs
  selectedDependencyAndEditionRefs
  selectedPublicationOrAccessCarrierRefs
  selectedSourcePackRefs
  selectedDecisionRefs
  qualityAndImprovementRefs
  currentnessAndRefreshRefs
  blockedOverreadRefs
  dependentUsePatternLocators
```

This map is a context record. It is not a new root kind and not a substitute for the exact subject assertions and defining or constraining ClaimGraphs it references.

Classify the family members as follows:

`Conceptual Core` is the legacy authority and publication-family partition. `First Principles Framework edition` is the whole scoped FPF framework edition as a transdisciplinary first-principles framework. `FPF Core pattern set` is the framework-edition view of the general FPF Core used for dependency, relation, and edition reasoning. These are related views and scopes, not competing core objects.

| Family member | Architecture role | Authoritative content loci |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conceptual Core | Core FPF distinctions, rules, and patterns that other FPF-grounded frameworks depend on. | `E.4`, `E.5.3`, and the exact subject patterns containing the defining ClaimGraphs |
| Tooling Reference | Optional tools, schemas, scripts, machine checks, or helper publications that inspect or support FPF use. | Use `E.17` for a source-backed publication face and return to source, `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence, form, carrier, audience, bounded use, and availability, and relevant tool patterns for their declared tool functions; use `G.5` only for a selector-facing selected-tool-set result declaration. |
| Pedagogical Companion | Tutorials, playbooks, worked examples, and learning material that teach FPF without changing Core meaning. | `E.17`, didactic patterns |
| Foundational principle pattern set | Foundational threshold material or principle patterns that may support FPF-grounded use but need settled names and dependency boundaries. | `F.18`, `E.4.PFR` |
| First Principles Framework edition | The scoped FPF framework edition as a transdisciplinary first-principles framework with Core pattern set, publication/access carriers, relation records, and whole-FPF adequacy route. | `E.4.FPF`, `E.2.DA`, `E.4.PFR`, `E.11`, `E.17`, `G.11` |
| FPF Core pattern set | The current general FPF pattern core as a framework edition. | `E.4`, `E.5.3`, and the current Core subject-pattern descriptions and defining ClaimGraphs |
| Domain principle framework | A domain-bounded framework grounded in FPF and in domain SoTA. | `E.4.DPF`, `G.2`, `E.4.PFAD`, `E.4.PFR` |
| Local practice framework | A project, organization, or role-context framework grounded in FPF and often in a domain framework. | `E.4.DPF`, `E.4.PFAD`, `E.4.PFR`, `G.11` |

The ordinary method is:

1. Declare the ecosystem scope and bounded context.
2. Name the family member being created, used, or changed.
3. List the selected structures that matter for the architecture claim: recurring problem-situation structures, known failure modes, reusable SoTA solution-move structures, pattern set, pattern-use relations, pattern-framework relations, decision records, dependency and edition records, publication/access carriers, source packs, quality records, and currentness records. For PF work, the pattern-language publication carrier exposes a reader-facing expression of that problem-and-solution architecture, not a neutral list of topics.
4. If the family member is FPF itself as a framework edition, open `E.4.FPF` for form, publication/access carriers, and whole-FPF adequacy routing.
5. Apply `E.5.3`: dependencies point toward more stable framework editions. FPF Core does not depend on domain or local frameworks.
6. State publication and first-entry claims using `E.11` and `E.17`; state framework-carrier structure-account assertions using `E.4.FPF` for FPF itself or `E.4.DPF`/`E.4.DPF.DA` for domain and local frameworks.
7. State pattern-use recommendation claims using `E.11.PUR`.
8. When a framework-architecture question is open, record the selected answer in one `E.9` DRR and use `E.4.PFAD` to profile its framework-specific content. Use `C.32.PAD` only for an exact project architecture decision and `C.32.ADR` only to project such a decision into an ADR-like publication.
9. State relation, dependency, compatibility, deprecation, and edition claims using `E.4.PFR` only when its named maintenance use requires that representation; otherwise use the direct subject assertion.
10. Settle names using `F.18`.
11. State SoTA and source-use claims using `G.2`.
12. State currentness, refresh, and edition-change claims using `G.11`, the exact edition values, and their source/currentness assertions.
13. Before using an all-in-one carrier, table of contents, relation graph, summary, skill pack, MCP-backed service, or generated carrier as evidence, state the exact source-return or preservation assertion under the predicate defined in `C.33`, `C.34`, or `C.35`.
14. Evaluate whole-FPF adequacy through `E.2.DA`, DPF or local-framework package adequacy through `E.4.DPF.DA`, individual pattern quality through `E.21`, improve through `E.23`, and use `E.19` only when the local process asks for admission review.

Use this routing table when a proposed change is ambiguous:

| Proposed work | Route to | Blocked overread |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The form of FPF itself changes: README, Preface, ToC, monolith, host set, skill pack, MCP-backed access, or whole-FPF publication/access route. | `E.4.FPF`, with `E.2.DA` for whole-FPF adequacy and `E.4.PFR` for relation or edition records. | Do not treat FPF as a DPF, do not use `E.4.DPF.DA` for whole-FPF adequacy, and do not treat a carrier as the framework edition. |
| A distinction or rule is intended to constrain ordinary FPF use across many domains and downstream frameworks depend on it. | FPF Core amendment through the current campaign and the exact subject patterns containing the changed assertions. | Do not promote a local checklist or domain technique to Core merely because it is useful. |
| A reusable principle supports FPF-grounded work but is not a general Core rule for all domains. | Foundational principle pattern set or other named framework edition, with `E.4.PFR` dependency records. | Do not hide a new framework edition inside the Core table of contents. |
| A source tradition or professional domain needs FPF-shaped patterns. | Domain principle framework through `E.4.DPF`, `G.2`, `E.4.PFAD`, and `E.4.PFR`. | Do not treat a literature summary as the framework. |
| One project, organization, role, or tool setting needs local practice guidance. | Local practice framework through `E.4.DPF`, with local source, owner, publication, quality, and refresh records. | Do not make local policy a general FPF rule. |
| Existing material is hard to find, teach, or publish. | Use `E.11` for discovery, the relevant didactic pattern for teaching, `E.17` for a source-backed publication face and return to source, and `E.24.PUB` for the publication occurrence, form, carrier, audience, bounded use, and availability. Use `G.5` only when the missing value is a selected-set result declaration. | Do not call publication repair architecture repair. |
| A cross-reference claims use, specialization, dependency, publication, source reuse, preservation, quality, deprecation, or supersession. | `E.4.PFR` for the relation function and edition effect. | Do not let a link label decide the relation meaning. |
| A framework split, dependency boundary, publication/access carrier, or adoption consequence must be decided. | Record one selected answer in an `E.9` DRR, using `E.4.PFAD` for its framework-specific content. Use `C.32.PAD` only when the decision is an exact project architecture decision and `C.32.ADR` only for its ADR-like projection. | Do not replace the answer with a diagram, folder, manifest, PFAD relation, or project-specific decision pattern used as the default framework route. |
| A source, search result, transformed view, or generated carrier supplies candidate material. | `G.2`, `C.33`, `C.34`, or `C.35` before architecture use. | Do not treat a carrier as authoritative because it has plausible names. |
| Whole-FPF adequacy, DPF package adequacy, individual pattern quality, repeated improvement, admission gating, or currentness is the live problem. | `E.2.DA`, `E.4.DPF.DA`, `E.21`, `E.23`, `E.19`, and `G.11` according to the claim. | Do not average pattern scores into package adequacy or whole-FPF adequacy, and do not run all quality gates when only one evaluation or refresh owner is live. |

This pattern should leave the reader with one architecture sentence: "This framework edition belongs to this family member, expresses this selected architecture of recurring problems and solution moves in pattern-language form, depends on these stable editions, publishes or gives access through these carriers, preserves these selected structures, and states each neighboring claim under its exact predicate or constraint with the subject pattern available as a locator."
