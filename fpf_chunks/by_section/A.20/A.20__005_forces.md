### A.20:3 - Forces

* **Separation of concerns.** Internal mechanism laws vs. external profile fit.
* **Auditability.** MVPK faces include pins/references only; no new numeric claims; editions and Γ are pinned where applicable.
* **Graph discipline.** One edge kind; all crossings mediated by gates; SquareLaw on every crossing.
* **Reproducible valuation.** Flow = valuation over `U.Transfer`, with slice‑local refresh bounded by sentinels.
* **LEX hygiene.** ASCII Tech labels, twin Tech/Plain registers, registered tokens.
