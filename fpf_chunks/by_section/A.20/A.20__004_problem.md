### A.20:2 - Problem

Without a clear CV core:

* internal step laws (domains/ranges, invariants, units coherence, Lipschitz/stability) bleed into gate **profile**;
* plane or comparator declarations sneak into mechanisms;
* freshness and DesignRunTag concerns appear inside mechanisms;
* reproducibility suffers because transfers start carrying hidden semantics beyond `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`.

Under this pattern, CV is evaluated **inside** transformations. **If** a check declares planes/units/comparators or depends on an active `GateProfile`, **then** it is treated as **GateFit at gates** and the CV explanation **does not apply**.
