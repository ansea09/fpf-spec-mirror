### B.1.6:10 - Conformance Checklist (complete)

| ID            | Requirement                                                                                                                                     | Purpose                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑B1.6.1** | Every Γ\_work result SHALL include a **Boundary Ledger**: boundary, time window, basis, method context, transformer identity.                   | Make Work statements comparable and auditable (A.10). |
| **CC‑B1.6.2** | Resource vectors SHALL be **typed**; no implicit unit conversions. Any equivalence MUST be declared in `M_spec` (or a domain-specific mechanisms).      | Prevent silent inflation/deflation.                   |
| **CC‑B1.6.3** | Resource stocks SHALL be structured with `PortionOf` and `PhaseOf`; `MemberOf` MUST NOT be used for resource mereology.                         | Align with A.14 and prevent category errors.          |
| **CC‑B1.6.4** | For partitioned boundaries `{Bᵢ}` the fold MUST satisfy partition additivity and document the partition.                                        | Enable cross‑scale roll‑ups.                          |
| **CC‑B1.6.5** | For time slicing `{τⱼ}` the fold MUST satisfy temporal additivity with non‑overlapping slices (Γ\_time‑compatible).                             | Keep history coherent.                                |
| **CC‑B1.6.6** | Critical inputs **Q\*** and their availability caps MUST be explicit; any violation SHALL cause the fold to fail or require an MHT declaration. | Enforce WLNK conservatism.                            |
| **CC‑B1.6.7** | If a shared internal stock exists between sub‑boundaries, it MUST be modelled in ΔStock\_inside(q) at the **parent** boundary level.            | Preserve conservation and COMM/LOC preconditions.     |
| **CC‑B1.6.8** | When `M_spec` declares a yield η, the report SHALL separate **planned** (ex‑ante) and **measured** (ex‑post) Work.                              | Keep planning distinct from accounting (A.15).        |
| **CC‑B1.6.9** | Γ\_work SHALL provide proofs of the invariant quintet under the independence assumptions used, or explicitly state where MHT is required.       | Maintain B.1 guarantees.                              |
