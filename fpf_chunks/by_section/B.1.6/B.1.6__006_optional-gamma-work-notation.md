### B.1.6:3 - Optional `Gamma_work` Notation

`Gamma_work` is optional notation for a recovered `WorkResourceAggregation@Context`.

```text
Gamma_work(workResourceAggregationRecord, resourceBasis, aggregationPolicy)
  -> aggregationResultRef, aggregationResultEpistemeRef
```

Use the notation only after naming the resource Characteristics, C.16 measurement Work and results, dated Work set and relevant A.15.1 Work-part relations, any C.27.TA overlap fact, any current non-Work carrier identity and `PhaseOf` relation, accounting boundary and time window, aggregation policy, and dated aggregation Work. The notation then summarizes that recovered aggregation record; each object, relation, method, Work, and emergence claim remains under its direct pattern.
