### E.5.3:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Agility vs Stability** | Tooling must iterate quickly ↔ Core must remain slow and deliberate. |
| **Reuse vs Isolation** | Authors want to reuse helper concepts ↔ Core cannot depend on volatile code. |
| **Simplicity** | Rule must be testable and unambiguous ↔ must allow legitimate upward imports. |
