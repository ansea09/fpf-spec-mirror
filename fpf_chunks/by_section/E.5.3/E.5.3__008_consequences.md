### E.5.3:7 - Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Core stays free of tool churn and tutorial bias. | Authors must create abstraction layers in Tooling instead of inserting hooks into Core. |
| Tooling and Pedagogy changes need not require a Core release. | Slight duplication when multiple tools target same concept; mitigated by shared Core definitions. |
