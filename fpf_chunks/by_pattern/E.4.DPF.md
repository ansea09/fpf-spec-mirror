## E.4.DPF - Domain Principle Framework Authoring and Publication-or-Access Carrier Assembly

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless marked informative.

### E.4.DPF:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when a group needs to create a domain principle framework or local practice framework grounded in FPF: for example a hydroponic-cucumber framework, a neural-network architecture framework, or a Codex-process framework.

This pattern describes the reusable way of authoring or revising an FPF-grounded framework, not the files that happen to carry it. Start by writing one paragraph that names the intended reader, first use, ordinary non-use boundary, and the domain or local situation. That paragraph is the first useful move: it is enough to enter the first-hour route before the framework architecture, durable names, or publication package are settled.

Use this pattern when the work creates or revises the framework itself. Use `E.11` or `E.17` when an existing framework remains unchanged and the work only changes how readers or agents find or access it.

### E.4.DPF:2 - Problem

Domain and local framework authors often have strong source material and urgent local needs, but they can lose FPF discipline in three ways. They copy FPF terms without settling the domain ontology. They publish a framework carrier before deciding the framework architecture. Or they produce a useful checklist that is local process guidance but not yet an FPF-grounded pattern framework.

A working framework needs more than a good table of contents. It needs source-grounded pattern selection, architecture decisions, relation records, edition dependencies, names, worked cases, quality evaluation, and refresh conditions.

A DPF is not a domain ontology, glossary, literature survey, or guide to talking about a topic. It exists so an intended practitioner or assisting agent can enter typical problem situations in the domain, avoid known failure modes, and apply source-grounded SoTA solution moves with visible boundaries and refresh conditions. Those failure modes include beginner mistakes and experienced-practitioner failures caused by stale, local-only, or non-SoTA practice. Ontology and vocabulary matter only insofar as they make those problem-solving moves safer and more reusable.

### E.4.DPF:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Domain urgency | The local team needs usable guidance soon, but premature durable names and pattern heads freeze poor ontology. |
| Source richness | Domain traditions provide valuable methods and examples, but source summaries can hide rival traditions and lost evidence. |
| Problem-solving primacy | A DPF may need terms and ontology, but those are supports for recognizing recurring domain problems and choosing SoTA solution moves, not the framework's payoff by themselves. |
| FPF reuse | FPF Core gives strong authoring, relation, and quality patterns, but direct copying can mask domain-specific concerns. |
| Publication need | A framework publication carrier helps readers, but it can hide relation, dependency, and currentness records. |
| Evolution | Domain and local frameworks change and improve as sources, uses, and Core editions change. |

### E.4.DPF:4 - Solution

Start here: write the one-paragraph use-frame note, then take the nine-step route below. The route lets a first-time framework author obtain one inspectable seed package and choose the exact first-result branch without first decoding the full precision model. Stop at the first-hour boundary unless the next receiving use already requires the complete route or stronger assurance.

First-hour route for a first framework:

1. Write a one-paragraph domain or local use-frame note: intended reader, first use, non-use boundary, effective ReferenceScheme, ClaimScope, and qualification window; add a selected BoundedModelUseStructure only if its organization changes interpretation for that use.
2. Create a source-pack stub: source traditions to inspect, rival traditions to avoid losing, first examples, and claim status.
3. Decide which first result is current. Before PFAD, create the C.2.1 proposal episteme locally called `FrameworkOrganizationDesignProposal` when review of candidate subject organization is current. Open E.4.PFAD when settlement of framework architecture is the current decision. Use C.30.AD only after the framework and its architecture exist; treat `ArchitectureDescriptionUseCard@Project` as its retrieval-only name and recover an actual composite project `U.Work` plus the separately obtaining project-use relation when project locality is claimed. Use the C.2.1 episteme locally called `FrameworkAuthoringDependencyDescription` only after PFAD.
4. For a pre-PFAD proposal, make the intended result present through one C.2.1 `IntendedFrameworkResultDescription` whose EntityOfConcern is the current A.15.2 `U.WorkPlan`. Keep its exact ClaimGraph, effective ReferenceScheme, ClaimScope, and any separately obtaining empirical-grounding relation distinct. Put candidate organization claims in the proposal's one ClaimGraph.
5. Mark public names provisional: use `Domain Principle Framework` or `Local Practice Framework` in prose, and send durable names or abbreviations to `F.18`.
6. Draft one to three first pattern candidates through `E.8`, each with a recognizable problem frame, known failure mode or local anti-pattern, positive SoTA-informed solution move, worked slice, and boundary. When a stable Solution benefits from a short repeatable Plain formulation, add a local mantra that preserves the Solution's operative distinctions and nearest stop or return condition. A local mantra is optional and pattern-specific; repetition does not make it a new Method, work order, U-kind, CGUS, or demonstrative unfolding slice. In the first hour these are pattern seeds unless they already pass the declared `E.21` pattern-quality use.
7. Add relation and edition rows for those candidates: source reuse, specialization, publication, dependency, compatibility, or currentness return as needed.
8. Pick the publication or access carrier: readme, preface, table of contents, card set, all-in-one local carrier, split document set, skill pack, MCP-backed access service, or another access face.
9. Name the first quality and currentness route: what will be evaluated, what can improve next, and what source, Core edition, or local-use change reopens the framework.

Stop the first hour when those outputs exist, even if every pattern body is still rough. A rough framework with a declared use frame, source basis, current first-result relation, provisional names, first pattern candidates, relation rows, publication or access carrier, quality route, and currentness return is inspectable. These are admitted outputs only through their direct owners and named receiving uses; list order does not produce them. A long all-in-one carrier without those outputs is not yet an FPF-grounded framework. Do not promote this rough output to a reliance-bearing DPF publication carrier until the DRR or decision carrier is checked for the intended authoring use, the pattern bodies are hardened as normal FPF patterns, and the package is evaluated through `E.4.DPF.DA`.

**Precision and object boundary after the first route.** The first-hour route is Plain application guidance for one exact run-independent framework-authoring `U.Method`; this E.4.DPF pattern is its action-guiding `U.MethodDescription` under `E.8` and `A.3.2`. The Method, this description episteme, any `U.WorkPlan`, every dated authoring `U.Work`, and every result remain different objects. An admitted authoring system performs dated Work under an obtaining `U.RoleAssignment`; the Work enacts the Method and may use this description through exact A.6.1 application and bindings. A numbered list, imperative sentence, document order, file layout, or coordination table neither performs Work nor establishes a result.

The first useful output is whichever exact current result and receiving use closes the immediate authoring question: a pre-PFAD organization-design proposal, a settled PFAD architecture decision, a post-existence architecture-description use, or a post-PFAD dependency description. Each output exists only when its direct owner admits it and an exact receiving use is named: `G.2` owns source-use results; E.4.DPF owns the pre-PFAD proposal and post-PFAD dependency description; `E.4.PFAD` owns the architecture decision; `E.8` owns pattern-authoring guidance; `E.4.PFR` owns relation and edition records; `E.24.PUB`, `E.11`, and `E.17` own publication or access uses; `E.4.DPF.DA` and `E.21` own evaluation results; `E.23` owns repeated improvement; and `G.11` owns currentness and refresh. Step completion, co-location in a package, or an arrow between labels supplies none of those result relations.

If one receiving use genuinely needs reusable conditional unfolding, select one exact `A.22.CGUS` `ConstraintGovernedUnfoldingStructure` separately from this MethodDescription. Recover its A.22 identity, independently governed constituents and obtaining relations, applied constraints, more than one admissible continuation, and explicit stops or returns; keep any demonstrative walkthrough as a separate C.2.1 episteme. Otherwise keep the route Plain. Neither the first-hour list nor the complete route is a CGUS merely because it contains branches or imperatives.

When dated authoring Work first constitutes a framework episteme or a revised framework episteme, recover that exact local inception claim through `A.15.PROD`; do not infer production from step order. C.2.1 identifies each authored framework episteme by its exact ClaimGraph, EntityOfConcern, and effective `U.ReferenceScheme`. An obtaining `EpistemeEditionRelation`, the authoring change or inception claim, the package architecture, and any `EpistemePublicationRelation` remain separately revisable. Publication occurrence, publication form, and presentation carrier establish availability only under `E.24.PUB`; they do not establish framework truth, edition continuity, or package membership.

The complete authoring account keeps the domain or local use frame, source basis, selected architecture, names, pattern drafts, relation and edition records, publication or access, quality, improvement, and currentness returns recoverable without turning their order into another object.

Default artifact contract for a request such as "make a DPF about this topic" separates claim-bearing epistemes, publication forms, and carriers. In a campaign or repository setting, create a developer decision carrier such as `SUBSTANTIVE-DRR.md` or `DPF-DRR.md` governed by `E.9` and checked by `E.9.DA`; it carries the source basis, selected architecture, PFAD decision, candidate pattern split, relation plan, quality plan, and rejected alternatives, while publishing or bearing the decision episteme rather than becoming that decision by file form. Create a user-facing framework publication or access carrier named by the individual framework, such as `<DomainOrPractice>-PRINCIPLES-FRAMEWORK.md`, `<PublicFrameworkName>.md`, a split readme, pattern, and appendix set, a skill pack, or an MCP-backed access service; it is the route through which readers or agents use the selected framework edition. Optional source-pack, E.4.PFR, quality-run, package-evaluation, skill-manifest, or access-service files may be separate when they need independent maintenance. C.2.1 framework-episteme identity, EpistemeEditionRelation, package architecture, E.24.PUB publication occurrence/form/carrier, and access use remain distinct; process state remains outside the user carrier.

Plain vocabulary for adoption:

| Public phrase | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `principle framework` | The general public phrase for an FPF-grounded framework of patterns, decisions, relation records, source basis, publication, quality, and refresh. |
| `Domain Principle Framework` | A principle framework for a domain such as greenhouse cucumbers, neural-network architecture, or safety certification practice. |
| `Local Practice Framework` | A principle framework for one organization, project, team, role context, or local operating practice. |
| `domain or local use frame` (`bounded context` in ordinary domain language) | The Plain description of where and for whom the framework meanings are intended to hold. Recover the effective `U.ReferenceScheme`, A.2.6 `ClaimScope`, intended reader/use, qualification window, and optional independently selected `BoundedModelUseStructure` separately when those distinctions are current; the word `context` supplies none of them by itself. |
| `framework edition` | One exact authored framework episteme at a selected edition boundary, with any obtaining C.2.1 `EpistemeEditionRelation`, E.4.PFR dependency/compatibility records, publication uses, quality result, and refresh route kept separately recoverable. A version label or package path alone establishes no edition continuity. |
| `framework publication carrier` | A `U.PresentationCarrier` that bears one selected framework publication form under E.24.PUB: for example a readme, preface, table of contents, pattern-body set, support maps, relation records, and refresh route. The carrier is not the framework episteme, edition relation, package architecture, publication occurrence, or publication form. |
| `framework access carrier` | A user-facing or agent-facing access carrier for a framework edition: all-in-one publication carrier, split document set, card set, skill pack, MCP-backed access service, retrieval route, or assistant integration. It exposes the selected framework edition; it does not define the framework architecture, source pack, quality result, runtime dependency, or work authority by itself. |
| `local monolith` | Workspace and editorial shorthand for one all-in-one framework publication carrier. Do not use it as the public framework name, and do not treat it as the framework architecture itself. |

Old intake labels such as `SPF`, `TPF`, or broad `xPF` remain source aliases until `F.18` settles a durable public name and any admissible short form. For the current FPF term set, `F.18` selects Tech name `FoundationalPrinciplePatternSet` with Plain name "foundational principle pattern set"; `ZPF` remains only its mnemonic alias, not a public "zero principles" framework name. If the alias suggests a different framework identity, return to the `F.18` naming settlement and use the full public name.

Keep the authoring apparatus proportional to the next receiving use. A first exploration may stop with the nine seed outputs and no separate publication package. A compact reliance-bearing framework may keep its readme, preface, pattern bodies, relation rows, source-use account, and quality route in one carrier when the same readers and stewards maintain them together. Split source packs, decision records, relation records, pattern files, quality results, skills, or access services only when independent editioning, confidentiality, transfer, automation, delayed feedback, expensive reversal, or another named reliance makes their identity separately useful. The pre-PFAD proposal exists only while candidate subject organization is the current result; the post-PFAD dependency description exists only when dependency availability and next-use relevance must be recovered. More files or records do not make the framework more mature.

If the requester wants a ready DPF rather than a seed, keep the developer DRR or decision carrier separate from the user DPF publication or access carrier, then name which `E.21`, `E.4.DPF.DA`, and currentness checks remain before reliance.
Do not present generated text as authoritative. Before reliance, name the unresolved claims and their returns to `G.2`, `C.35`, `E.4.PFAD`, `E.4.PFR`, `F.18`, `E.21`, and `G.11`.
```

1. **Domain or local use-frame declaration.** State the intended reader, first use, non-use boundary, effective ReferenceScheme, ClaimScope, and qualification window. Select a BoundedModelUseStructure only when its exact organization changes interpretation for this receiving use; the word `context` and a package boundary establish none of these.
2. **Source pack.** Use `G.2` to gather SoTA traditions, claim sheets, examples, source-use decisions, rejected alternatives, and source-currentness notes.
3. **Organization proposal or architecture decision.** Before PFAD, use E.4.DPF to create the current C.2.1 organization-design proposal described in 4.2-4.4. When framework-architecture settlement is current, use `E.9` and `E.4.PFAD` to decide purpose, framework family, domain or local problem-and-solution architecture, pattern split, relation structure, publication and access architecture, dependency boundary, and source-return conditions. Keep the decision relation, decision episteme, package architecture, relation records, edition dependencies, and any ADR-like publication distinct. Do not use a dependency description to postpone PFAD.
4. **Name preparation.** Use `E.10` for kind discipline and `F.18` for durable names before public pattern heads or abbreviations are stabilized.
5. **Carrier admission.** Use `C.33`, `C.34`, or `C.35` before relying on all-in-one carriers, tables of contents, relation graphs, source summaries, search outputs, transformed views, or generated candidates as architecture evidence.
6. **Pattern drafting.** Draft patterns with `E.8`: recognition text, positive solution, worked cases, boundary, local anti-patterns, SoTA-Echoing, conformance checks, and relations. In a DPF, those pattern bodies render selected domain or local problem-situation architecture and solution-move architecture. `E.8` means a normal action-guiding `MethodDescription`, not only a section skeleton. When repeated first use benefits from an attentional aid, write a Plain local mantra by compressing that pattern's Solution without dropping the distinction that makes the move work or the stop, return, or redirect condition. Keep an established local name such as `mnemonic`, `watchword`, or `heuristic` when it explains the aid better. Use `A.22.CGUS` only when an independently selected `ConstraintGovernedUnfoldingStructure` has exact constituents, obtaining relations, constraints, admissible continuations, and stops; keep its demonstration separate. A thin skeleton, prompt seed, compressed design note, or memorable slogan detached from the Solution remains a pattern seed until `E.21` says the pattern is adequate for the declared DPF use.
7. **Relation and edition discipline.** Use `E.4.PFR` for relation functions, dependency direction, compatibility boundary, deprecation, supersession, and edition effects.
8. **Quality cycle.** Use `E.22` to frame the evaluation purpose, quality floor, trade-off question, and expected improvement proposal when that frame is not already scoped. Use `E.4.DPF.DA` to evaluate the package as a DPF or local-framework package, `E.21` to evaluate individual pattern quality, `E.23` for repeated improvement, and `E.19` only when admission or profile gating is actually being claimed. If an evaluation result needs a carrier, publish or refresh that carrier through the pattern governing its publication or currentness relation rather than through `E.22`.
9. **Admission review.** Use `E.19` when the local process asks whether a pattern or framework slice is ready for admission.
10. **Framework publication-or-access carrier assembly.** Expose the selected framework episteme edition through exact publication or access relations: an all-in-one local carrier, split readme/preface/pattern files, table of contents, cards, skill pack, MCP-backed access service, retrieval route, or another first-use form. Under E.24.PUB keep publication occurrence, selected episteme edition, audience declaration, bounded-use declaration, publication form, and presentation carrier distinct. Do not infer framework identity, package membership, truth, Work authority, or landing from carrier assembly, and do not land domain or local frameworks into `FPF-Spec.md` by default.
11. **Currentness route.** Use `G.11` for refresh plans, edition pins, source decay, deprecation, and supersession conditions.

Localize each repair before returning to wider framework architecture. A changed source payload first returns to its `G.2` source-use decision and then only to patterns, examples, or relations that relied on that payload. A changed Core or depended-on framework edition first updates the affected `E.4.PFR` dependency, compatibility, and migration relations. Repeated misuse of one pattern first returns to that pattern's `E.21` result and its `E.23` improvement loop. A failed publication or access route first returns to `E.11`, `E.17`, or the carrier relation that exposed it. A local mantra that no longer preserves its pattern's Solution first returns to that pattern body; `A.22.CGUS` becomes current only if the repaired aid must present a wider conditional unfolding. Return to `E.4.PFAD` only when the evidence changes selected framework-family, pattern-split, relation-structure, publication or access architecture, or dependency-boundary decisions. Use `G.11` when edition currentness, source decay, telemetry, deprecation, or supersession must be orchestrated across those local repairs.

For an all-in-one DPF publication carrier, assemble the content in a reproducible order. This order is a publication shape, not a new framework kind:

1. Public framework title and package edition ref: use a domain- or practice-specific framework name such as `<DomainOrPractice> Principles Framework`; `Principles Framework` alone is only the head or kind phrase, not an individual framework name. Do not put `local monolith`, `draft`, process status, or file-layout slang in the public title.
2. Dependency declaration: FPF Core edition, depended-on DPF or local-framework editions, and blocked reverse dependency.
3. Table of contents: pattern bodies first as the main language of use; support maps and relation records remain reachable without becoming a universal first inspection sequence.
4. Readme or first practical entries: intended reader, first use, non-use boundary, first outputs, and a short statement of which selected domain or local structures this carrier exposes for that reader.
5. Preface or framework context: cross-cutting ideas that make the pattern set cohere, plus the selected structure families the carrier foregrounds, deliberately coarsens, defers, or sends back to sources and pattern bodies.
6. Package carrier structure-account: intended reader and use, selected source-structure denominator, recurring problem-situation structures, reusable solution-move structures, captured structure, deliberately coarsened, abstracted, omitted, or lost structure, source-return condition, and quality or epiplexity route. This may be a short subsection in the readme or preface when the carrier is compact.
7. Package boundary and governing-pattern routing: Core governing patterns reused, local terms bounded, and source, evidence, assurance, publication, and refresh exits named.
8. Pattern index: pattern ids, titles, first use, and any local prefix discipline.
9. Pattern bodies: each drafted through `E.8`, with recognition text, positive solution, worked cases, local anti-patterns, SoTA-Echoing, conformance checks, and relations, and each evaluated or explicitly marked as a seed under `E.21` before the package is claimed for public, teaching, enterprise, or reliance-bearing use.
10. Heterogeneous acceptance cases or transfer probes: examples that force the pattern set to work across unlike uses rather than only repeating the motivating case.
11. Support maps or appendices: architecture bridge, source-use map, precision map, package-name route, or other reference material placed after pattern bodies unless a short front-door trigger table is needed.
12. Source use and refresh map: source rows with adopted payload, rejected or bounded readings, return conditions to `G.2` for source use, and return conditions to `G.11` for source currentness or refresh orchestration.
13. Pattern-framework relation and edition records: `E.4.PFR` rows for dependency, specialization, publication, source reuse, evaluation, generated-carrier, teaching publication-carrier, ethics, deprecation, or supersession relations.
14. Refresh route: what returns to source, pattern quality, package adequacy, edition dependency, or publication carrier when source, Core edition, local use, telemetry, or evaluation changes.
Every DPF publication or access carrier bears or serves a publication expression or access expression that makes selected domain or local structures available for a declared reader and use; the carrier is not itself the framework edition, the domain, or a narrative by type. In an all-in-one publication carrier, the readme and preface usually carry the first explanatory route, and sometimes a narrative rendering, through the domain. Their representation relation remains inspectable when they say what they are telling, for whom, which structures they foreground, which structures are deliberately coarsened, abstracted, omitted, or left to source return, and where a reader returns for fuller pattern, source, evidence, or relation detail. This is not only text-to-text summarization: the source-bearing side may be actual or possible holon structure, an architecture description, a view, a source pack, a model, a graph, or a pattern set. In architecture-mediated narrative-rendering use, read the return chain as `narrative rendering carried by a publication or access carrier -> architecture description or view -> architecture as selected structures under its exact use frame -> wider source structures`. When no narrative rendering is present, read the first step as `framework publication or access carrier -> selected source structures`. Each step has selected structure, captured structure, coarsening, abstraction, omission, loss, and return conditions. An architecture description is often already a coarsened representation of selected real, expected, candidate, or actual structures, so the DPF carrier keeps that second-step loss visible. This does not make every DPF a literary narrative or make every carrier a narrative; it makes the publication-expression or access-expression representation relation inspectable. When a sequential narrative rendering is load-bearing, use `A.6.3.NAR`; when the publication expression deliberately keeps only a narrower-use coarsened rendering, use `A.6.3.CSC`; for structure capture and loss, use `C.33`; for same-enough or preservation claims, use `C.34`; for practical-use publication, use `E.11` and `E.17`; for package adequacy, use `E.4.DPF.DA`.

Keep process state out of the carrier. DRR text, handoff notes, ledger rows, review status, helper state, admission blockers, and landing evidence may shape the package, but the publication carrier should contain only durable user-facing package content, source-use boundaries, relation records, quality routes, and refresh conditions. A short source-use or relation record may appear in the user carrier when it helps readers and maintainers use the DPF; a DRR argument, review transcript, or quality proof does not.

For skill packs and MCP-backed access, keep the same framework edition identity and relation records visible. A skill or endpoint may help a user find, select, retrieve, render, or apply DPF patterns, but it is an access carrier until another governing pattern makes a stronger claim. If the carrier generates candidate text, use `C.35`; if it performs work or triggers tools, use `A.15` and the pattern governing the local tool or work relation; if it claims currentness, evidence, assurance, or decision authority, use `G.11`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `E.9`, or the pattern governing that exact claim. Do not read a skill manifest, MCP tool name, endpoint schema, or protocol route as the DPF architecture.

Starter evaluation characteristics for a principle-framework improvement loop:

| Characteristic question | Governing pattern to use |
| --- | --- |
| Discoverability | Can the intended reader find the first useful entry and governing pattern? Use `E.11`, then evaluate the pattern or projection through the applicable evaluation pattern. |
| Source fidelity | Are adopted and rejected source payloads recoverable in source packs, solutions, boundaries, and examples? Use `G.2`, `C.33`, `C.34`, and pattern-quality evaluation. |
| Ontology clarity | Are Core, domain, local, publication, source, decision, relation, quality, and refresh claims kept as different kinds? Use `E.10`, `F.18`, `F.19`, and the pattern governing the exact claim. |
| Relation typedness | Are pattern-use, specialization, dependency, publication, preservation, quality, and source-use relations separated? Use `E.4.PFR`. |
| Compatibility impact | Can maintainers see which structures or claims break and which migrations become current when Core, domain, or local editions change? Use `E.4.PFR`, `E.5.3`, and `G.11`. |
| Refreshability | Are source decay, edition pins, local-use telemetry, and supersession conditions actionable? Use `G.11`. |
| Package navigability | Can the selected pattern set, relation records, source packs, decision records, quality evidence, and practical-use or access carrier be found without treating the package as runtime machinery? Use `G.5`, `E.4.PFR`, and `E.11`. |
| Adoption telemetry | Are repeated reader errors, skipped records, stale sources, and local-use failures routed to refresh or improvement? Use `G.11` and `E.23`. |
| Didactic first use | Can a first-time domain or local author write the first useful output without prior FPF developer knowledge? Use `E.11`, `E.12`, `E.21`, and `E.23`. |

These are evaluation characteristics for selecting and framing improvement work. They are not measurement programs by themselves. If the pass needs a DPF package adequacy result, use `E.4.DPF.DA`; if it needs individual pattern quality, use `E.21`; if it needs DRR adequacy, FPF-level Pillar adequacy, measurement, evidence, or architecture-characteristic evaluation, use the pattern that owns that object, such as `E.9.DA`, `E.2.DA`, `C.16`, `A.10`, or the relevant architecture-characteristic pattern.

The MethodDescription and its result/use account are sufficient only when a reader can answer: which framework episteme edition is being authored; which dated Work, exact Method enactment, and result relation are current; what problem-and-solution architecture it renders; which sources and decisions shaped it; which patterns, relation records, and edition dependencies were selected; which publication occurrence, form, carrier, or access relation exposes it; how quality improves; and when it returns for refresh or repair.

#### E.4.DPF:4.1 - Select the current first result

DPF authoring has four possible first results under explicit conditions:

1. `E.4.DPF Solution -> FrameworkOrganizationDesignProposal` when PFAD is not yet settled and the immediate result is a current proposal episteme that makes candidate organization claims about an intended future framework result reviewable. The proposal exists now; the future framework need not.
2. `E.4.PFAD Solution -> exact framework-architecture decision relation` when framework family, Core dependency boundary, content boundary, pattern relation structure, or publication and access architecture is the current decision question. This is the first settled framework-architecture result; its decision episteme, decision relation, and any ADR-like publication remain distinct under their direct owners.
3. `C.30.AD Solution -> ArchitectureDescriptionUseCard@Project` only after the relevant framework entity, exact C.30 architecture relation, and selected architecture-relevant structures exist and the immediate question is how that architecture description may be used. `ArchitectureDescriptionUseCard@Project` is C.30.AD's retrieval-only foreign name: `@Project` supplies no project identity or locality. When an actual project matters, recover the exact composite project `U.Work` under `A.15.6` and the separately obtaining architecture-description project-use relation under its direct owner.
4. `E.4.DPF Solution -> FrameworkAuthoringDependencyDescription` only when PFAD exists and the immediate question is which later authoring dependencies exist and which are relevant to the next authoring use.

The pre-PFAD result is one present proposal episteme, not a reference to the absent future framework and not an architecture description. It conforms to C.2.1 instead of defining a second local episteme architecture. The four results are alternatives selected by the current question; list order neither produces them nor makes them stages of one universal lifecycle.

#### E.4.DPF:4.2 - Make the intended result reviewable before PFAD

First make the design target present. `IntendedFrameworkResultDescription` is an ordinary local use name for one exact current C.2.1 `U.Episteme`, not a root kind or card kind. C.2.1 identifies it by:

```text
<exact intended-result ClaimGraph,
 current DPF-authoring U.WorkPlan as EntityOfConcern,
 effective U.ReferenceScheme>
```

The current A.15.2 WorkPlan declares coordination claims for possible future DPF-authoring Work, the intended framework-result kind, and its acceptance target. It is present now; a dated authoring Work occurrence and the framework result may remain future. The intended-result ClaimGraph states the domain or local use frame, readers, first uses, purpose, declared relation-family coverage constraints, intended-result constraints, and acceptance conditions. The effective `U.ReferenceScheme` interprets those claims. One exact A.2.6 `ClaimScope` separately bounds which claims and uses are current; changing scope does not substitute for changing the C.2.1 identity triple.

Do not add a generic context, description-context, or grounding position. If interpretation for the receiving use genuinely depends on an independently selected `BoundedModelUseStructure`, cite that exact A.1.1/A.22 structure as an optional neighboring use qualification; it does not replace effective ReferenceScheme or ClaimScope and does not enter episteme identity. If empirical grounding is current, state a separate C.2.1 `EpistemeEmpiricalGroundingRelation` to one exact A.1-admitted holon and the covered claim subgraph. The grounding relation, its evidence, the WorkPlan, any dated authoring Work, an actual A.15.6 composite project Work, and the description episteme remain distinct. Plain `project` wording mints no U-kind.

Each declared relation-family coverage constraint is one `FrameworkOrganizationCandidateClaimNode` with `claimNodeKind=constraint`. Its `coveredRelationFamilyRefKindPairs[1..*]` identifies each covered relation-family value together with its exact kind; `admittedFrameworkUseDescriptionRef` names the use for which that coverage matters; and `coverageCriterionDescriptionRef` states how satisfaction of this coverage constraint is judged. A current A.15.2 WorkPlan acceptance target remains a different position: cite it through `designBasisRefs[]` or its direct acceptance-target relation. It neither replaces the coverage criterion nor shares one union field with it.

#### E.4.DPF:4.3 - Create one C.2.1 proposal episteme

The organization proposal uses the present intended-result description as its one EntityOfConcern:

```text
FrameworkOrganizationDesignProposal:
  C2_1Identity:
    entityOfConcernRef: U.EpistemeRef
      = current IntendedFrameworkResultDescription episteme
    claimGraph: U.ClaimGraph
    effectiveReferenceScheme: U.ReferenceScheme
  claimScopeRef: ClaimScopeRef governed by A.2.6
  intendedReaderDescriptionRef: U.EpistemeRef
  intendedFirstUseDescriptionRef: U.EpistemeRef
  modelUseStructureRef?: U.StructureRef
    only when one selected BoundedModelUseStructure changes interpretation for this use
  empiricalGroundingRelationRefs?: FinSet(U.RelationRef)
    only for separately obtaining C.2.1 empirical-grounding relations
```

`FrameworkOrganizationDesignProposal` is a local use label for that exact C.2.1 episteme, not a second U-kind. Its one EntityOfConcern, one constituting ClaimGraph, and one effective ReferenceScheme supply episteme identity. ClaimScope, reader and use descriptions, optional model-use structure, empirical-grounding relations, A.7 provenance, F.15 proposal-status assertions when current, publication, and edition continuity are neighboring claims or relations; none is another identity slot. A changed ClaimGraph, EntityOfConcern, or effective scheme identifies another episteme. A changed grounding relation alone changes that relation, not the proposal identity.

No generic grounding branch or unnamed Bridge is admitted. F.9 becomes current only for an exact cross-context local-sense translation with its own endpoints and predicate, not because two users, organizations, or empirical grounds differ. No `CandidateFrameworkOrganizationClaim` episteme kind is introduced. Candidate claims are typed nodes in the proposal's ClaimGraph, with logical, alternative, refinement, dependency, support, conflict, and answer-to-question edges as current.

Each candidate organization claim node makes the subject-level proposal recoverable:

```text
FrameworkOrganizationCandidateClaimNode:
  claimNodeKey: semantic key unique within claimGraph
  claimNodeKind: FrameworkOrganizationClaimNodeKindValue
  claimStatus: FrameworkOrganizationClaimStatusValue
  intendedResultAspect: FrameworkOrganizationAspectValue
  describedPositionKinds[1..*]: U.Kind
  proposedSubjectRelationSignatures[0..*]: RelationSignature
  proposedConstraintDescriptionRefs[0..*]: U.EpistemeRef
  coveredRelationFamilyRefKindPairs[0..*]: FrameworkRelationFamilyRefKindPair; cardinality [1..*] for a relation-family coverage constraint node
  admittedFrameworkUseDescriptionRef?: U.EpistemeRef; exactly one for a relation-family coverage constraint node
  coverageCriterionDescriptionRef?: U.EpistemeRef; exactly one for a relation-family coverage constraint node
  proposedInvariantDescriptionRefs[0..*]: U.EpistemeRef
  proposedDependencyDirectionDescriptionRefs[0..*]: U.EpistemeRef
  alternativeGroupKey?: semantic key unique within claimGraph
  designBasisRefs[1..*]: U.EpistemeRef
  designQuestionRefs[1..*]: U.EpistemeRef
  pfadSettlementConditionRef?: U.EpistemeRef

FrameworkRelationFamilyRefKindPair:
  relationFamilyRef: U.EntityRef
  relationFamilyKindRef: U.KindRef
```

`FrameworkOrganizationCandidateClaimNode` is a local ClaimGraph node form, not a U-kind and not an episteme. `FrameworkOrganizationClaimNodeKindValue` is the local C.2.1-compatible enumeration `definition | constraint | property | assumption`. A node with `claimNodeKind=constraint` classifies a proposed constraint claim; its `proposedConstraintDescriptionRefs[]` identify the exact constraint descriptions that the node asserts, while a non-constraint node may cite those refs only when they qualify that definition, property, or assumption.

A relation-family coverage constraint node also has non-empty `coveredRelationFamilyRefKindPairs[]`, one `admittedFrameworkUseDescriptionRef`, and one `coverageCriterionDescriptionRef`; other claim nodes leave all three coverage positions absent. Each pair identifies one relation-family value and its exact kind without a union field or an untyped companion list. A WorkPlan acceptance target, when current, is cited separately through `designBasisRefs[]` or its direct acceptance-target relation. Neither constraint position is deontic. If an obligation, recommendation-as-duty, or prohibition with an accountable subject and issuing or authority relation is current, use `A.2.8 -> U.Commitment`; if a strong or weak permission, exercise, non-violation, or permission-conflict claim is current, use the exact `A.2.8.PER` result with the participants, references, constructive ground, and qualifiers required by that selected object.

`FrameworkOrganizationClaimStatusValue` is the local enumeration `candidateProposed | rejectedAlternative | unresolved`. `FrameworkOrganizationAspectValue` is the local enumeration `frameworkFamily | component | dependency | patternRelation | publication | access`; a domain extension adds another value only together with its exact interpretation rule in the proposal's effective ReferenceScheme. Proposedness is claim modality: it says that a relation signature, position, constraint, invariant, or dependency direction is being proposed for the intended result. It asserts neither an actual relation occurrence nor an actual `U.Structure`, and it is not encoded as a pattern-use boundary condition.

The proposal's effective ReferenceScheme maps each organization-aspect value, described position kind, and proposed relation signature to claims about the intended result described by the EntityOfConcern; distinguishes ClaimGraph edges from the subject relations those claims propose; declares how basis and design-question refs qualify each claim; and states that claim status is modal rather than actual. Thus a claim node can propose that one pattern family depends on Core, that publication and access remain separate positions, or that one relation invariant is preserved, without pretending that the future framework or those relations already exist.

#### E.4.DPF:4.4 - Preserve result, PFAD, structure, and architecture boundaries

Keep the two result positions separate. If reliance-bearing E.11.PUA support materializes an exact expected-result support object for this E.4.DPF application, its expected result kind is the C.2.1 proposal episteme locally called `FrameworkOrganizationDesignProposal`. The intended later framework edition is described inside the separate `IntendedFrameworkResultDescription` and the proposal's ClaimGraph. One expectation support object never denotes both results, and neither object says the result was produced without the exact current work/result or inception claim.

PFAD return is also separate from claim modality. When a reliance-bearing use needs an addressable return condition, the exact E.11.PUA boundary support names E.4.PFAD as the receiving pattern and states which candidate claim, alternative, unresolved position, constraint, or dependency makes framework-architecture settlement current. That support is adjacent to use of the proposal; it is not a component that makes a claim proposed.

Subject organization is recovered from the candidate claim nodes, proposed subject relation signatures, described position kinds, constraints, invariants, dependency directions, alternatives, basis, questions, and PFAD settlement conditions. An A.22 `U.Structure` over the proposal ClaimGraph is optional and admissible only when the organization of the proposal episteme itself is a separate current EntityOfConcern. A selected `BoundedModelUseStructure` is a still different optional use qualification, admitted only when that exact organization changes interpretation for the receiving claim. Neither structure is the admission criterion for the proposal or a substitute for the organization being proposed. A topic list fails because it lacks candidate organization claims and proposed subject relation content, even if its headings or ClaimGraph are well organized.

Pre-realization C.33 notes compare proposal content only with a declared current comparator: design questions, present basis epistemes, candidate alternatives, a relation-family coverage constraint claim node for an admitted framework use, or an earlier existing framework edition. When coverage is the comparator, C.33 cites the exact candidate claim node and reads its covered family ref-kind pairs, admitted use, and coverage criterion. A separate WorkPlan acceptance target may appear in `designBasisRefs[]` or through its direct relation but never substitutes for the coverage criterion. The notes may report represented, omitted, hidden, or unresolved candidate organization content relative to that basis. They do not claim captured structure relative to an unknown future actual framework. Comparison with actual framework structures starts only after the framework entity and relevant structures exist.

No E.17.0 description/viewpoint device targets the absent future framework. Later E.4.PFAD, C.32, C.30, and C.30.AD results use their direct patterns and admission conditions; none retroactively retypes this proposal, its intended-result description, or its optional meta-structure as architecture or as an architecture description. C.30.AD's `ArchitectureDescriptionUseCard@Project` remains a retrieval cue; actual project locality additionally requires the exact composite project `U.Work` and its exact separately obtaining description-use relation.

#### E.4.DPF:4.5 - Describe post-PFAD authoring dependencies

The dependency description is minimal and status-bearing. It does not presume that later authoring products already exist:

```text
FrameworkAuthoringDependencyDescription:
  C2_1Identity:
    entityOfConcernRef: U.EpistemeRef
      = current DPF-authoring U.WorkPlan
    claimGraph: U.ClaimGraph
      = dependency-position claims and their availability, relevance, value,
        governing-pattern, acquisition-condition, and next-use-boundary claims
    effectiveReferenceScheme: U.ReferenceScheme
      = interpretation of those claims for the declared next authoring use
  claimScopeRef: ClaimScopeRef governed by A.2.6
  intendedReaderDescriptionRef: U.EpistemeRef
  intendedFirstUseDescriptionRef: U.EpistemeRef
  dependencyPositions[3..*]: FrameworkAuthoringDependencyPosition
  nextAuthoringUseBoundaryDescriptionRef: U.EpistemeRef
  modelUseStructureRef?: U.StructureRef
    only when one selected BoundedModelUseStructure changes interpretation for this use
  empiricalGroundingRelationRefs?: FinSet(U.RelationRef)
    only for separately obtaining C.2.1 empirical-grounding relations

FrameworkAuthoringDependencyPosition:
  dependencyPositionKey: semantic key unique within claimGraph
  dependencyKind: FrameworkAuthoringDependencyKindValue
  dependencyAvailability: FrameworkAuthoringDependencyAvailabilityValue
  dependencyUseRelevance: FrameworkAuthoringDependencyUseRelevanceValue
  dependencyValueRef?: U.EntityRef
  dependencyValueKindRef?: U.KindRef
  dependencyGoverningPatternRef: U.EpistemeRef constrained by A.3.2 to U.MethodDescription
  dependencyAcquisitionConditionDescriptionRef?: U.EpistemeRef
```

`FrameworkAuthoringDependencyDescription` is a local use label for one exact C.2.1 episteme, and each `FrameworkAuthoringDependencyPosition` is a local ClaimGraph node form rather than a U-kind, entity, relation occurrence, or package member. The description's current authoring WorkPlan EntityOfConcern, one ClaimGraph, and effective ReferenceScheme supply identity. ClaimScope, reader and use descriptions, optional model-use structure, empirical grounding, A.7 provenance, F.15 dependency-assessment status when current, publication, and edition continuity remain separate. A different empirical ground or use frame does not become an identity field; changed ClaimGraph, EntityOfConcern, or effective scheme identifies another episteme.

`FrameworkAuthoringDependencyKindValue` is `fpfCoreEdition | sourceBasis | frameworkArchitectureDecision | nameRoute | patternDraftSet | relationAndEditionRecords | publicationOrAccess | packageQuality | improvement | currentness`. `FrameworkAuthoringDependencyAvailabilityValue` is `available | missing`. `FrameworkAuthoringDependencyUseRelevanceValue` is `currentForNextAuthoringUse | retainedForLaterUse | relevanceUnsettled`.

The minimum three positions are exactly one `fpfCoreEdition`, one `sourceBasis`, and one `frameworkArchitectureDecision`. The architecture-decision position and the Core-edition position are `available` and carry exact value and kind refs; otherwise the post-PFAD dependency description is not yet admissible. The source-basis position follows the ordinary availability and relevance branches below and may therefore expose a blocking missing source pack. Add another dependency kind only when the declared next authoring use relies on that dependency or deliberately retains it for a named later use.

When `dependencyAvailability=available`, the exact dependency value ref and kind ref are present and `dependencyAcquisitionConditionDescriptionRef` is absent. When `dependencyAvailability=missing`, the value ref and kind ref are absent and the acquisition-condition description is present. Next-use relevance remains independent in both branches: `missing + currentForNextAuthoringUse` blocks the next authoring use and opens the stated return, while `missing + retainedForLaterUse` does not block the current use. A condition on using an available dependency belongs to that dependency's direct governing pattern or to the next-use boundary, never to the acquisition position.

Every admitted dependency description contains a `frameworkArchitectureDecision` position with `availability=available` and the exact E.4.PFAD decision ref and kind, and an `fpfCoreEdition` position with the exact selected Core-edition ref and kind. A missing PFAD returns to E.4.PFAD and prevents construction of the description. A missing or unsettled Core-edition decision returns to the dependency boundary settled by E.4.PFAD and E.4.PFR before this description resumes.

As authoring proceeds, the same description may refer to E.4.PFAD architecture decisions; E.4.PFR relation records and edition dependencies; G.2 source packs; subject-home NameCards; E.8 pattern drafts; E.24.PUB/E.11/E.17 publication or access uses; E.4.DPF.DA evaluation results; E.23 improvement results; and G.11 currentness relations. Each dependency value, relation occurrence, evaluation result, edition relation, and receiving use remains governed and identified separately. The description is neither the framework episteme edition, its package architecture, a publication occurrence, publication form, carrier, dated authoring Work, nor a substitute for any dependency value.

### E.4.DPF:5 - Archetypal Grounding


Tell: A hydroponic-cucumber framework begins with crop-production concerns, horticulture and greenhouse-control sources, local examples, and FPF Core dependency. Its first all-in-one publication carrier is for domain users, while relation records, source packs, and quality evaluations remain separately recoverable.

Show: A neural-network architecture framework may draw on dataflow architecture, model components, training and inference concerns, evaluation practice, and recent architecture-analysis work. The framework can describe layers, blocks, flows, optimization constraints, and interpretability concerns; each resulting pattern is grounded through `G.2`, drafted through `E.8`, and related through `E.4.PFR`.

Show: A workspace-specific Codex process framework can contain prelanding and baton-handoff patterns. It should state its local context, dependency on FPF Core, process sources, local carriers, and refresh route. A useful local checklist stays a local checklist until it has source grounding, pattern bodies, relation records, and quality evaluation.

Show: An enterprise local practice framework for architecture review starts from the organization's review context, internal policies, proprietary examples, and approval path. It can depend on FPF Core and on a domain principle framework, but its confidential evidence, role assignments, training plan, and rollout telemetry stay local.

Enterprise local-practice slice:

| Output | Enterprise question |
| --- | --- |
| Local context | Which organization, product line, team, role context, and decision class is governed? |
| Internal sources | Which policies, standards, review records, incidents, templates, and examples are adopted or rejected? |
| Constraints | Which regulatory, confidentiality, intellectual-property, tool-access, and security boundaries constrain publication? |
| Stewardship assignments | Which steward role is assigned responsibility for the framework edition, source pack, relation records, publication or access carrier, and refresh plan? |
| Approval route | Which management, engineering, safety, legal, or assurance reviews are needed before local use? |
| Rollout and training | Which roles need first-use examples, training material, and migration support? |
| Dependency | Which FPF Core edition and domain framework edition are depended on, and which reverse dependency is blocked? |
| Migration | What changes after FPF Core edition change, domain-framework edition change, policy change, or repeated local misuse? |
| Adoption telemetry | Which reader errors, skipped relation records, stale source packs, or quality regressions trigger `G.11` refresh? |

Replayable authoring slice:

| Authoring output | Filled slice |
| --- | --- |
| Domain or local use-frame declaration | `GreenhouseCropDomain`; effective scheme and ClaimScope named; intended reader: crop-system architect and senior grower; first use: decide first pattern set for cucumber production guidance; non-use and qualification window explicit |
| `G.2` source pack | greenhouse climate-control sources, crop nutrition sources, local production logs; rejected source: generic gardening advice without controlled-environment evidence |
| Architecture decision | `PFAD-HC-001` selects four first patterns, a publication or access carrier, and a one-way dependency on FPF Core; the domain framework is not incorporated into FPF Core |
| Naming route | provisional `HydroponicCucumberPrincipleFramework`; the public abbreviation remains provisional until an `F.18` NameCard is current |
| First pattern draft | `HC.NutrientMonitoring` drafted with `E.8`: problem frame, solution, worked greenhouse slice, SoTA row, conformance checks |
| Relation and edition record | `PFR-HC-source-reuse` links nutrient pattern to source pack; dependency record points to `FPFCorePatternSet@current` |
| Quality cycle | `E.22` frames evaluation purpose; `E.21` scores first draft; `E.23` records the next improvement loop |
| Local publication or access | framework readme, table of contents, skill pack, or MCP-backed access route exposes the framework after source-return notes are present |
| Refresh route | `G.11` refresh when source pack, Core edition, or greenhouse-control practice changes |

#### Local-mantra authoring slice

After the `HC.NutrientMonitoring` Solution is stable, its authors use the local mantra: *Name the crop stage and root-zone condition; establish that the measurement is usable in its current calibration range; compare it with the stage-specific range; change the control setting only within the declared operating boundary; return when crop stage, sensor validity, or operating boundary changes.* The formula helps a grower or crop-system architect keep the pattern's operative distinctions and return condition in attention. It remains Plain wording inside `HC.NutrientMonitoring`; it is not another nutrient-control method, work order, U-kind, or F.17 publication obligation.

If a seminar instead needs to show alternative continuations for invalid measurement, out-of-range nutrient condition, control saturation, and crop-stage transition through one named wider unfolding structure, the authors open `A.22.CGUS` and build a demonstrative walkthrough. They do not obtain that structure merely by extending or repeating the local mantra.

#### Pre-PFAD proposal slice

A team intends a new clinical-method DPF but has not decided its framework architecture. It creates one current `U.WorkPlan` for possible future DPF-authoring Work, then one C.2.1 `IntendedFrameworkResultDescription` whose identity is its exact intended-result ClaimGraph, that WorkPlan as EntityOfConcern, and its effective ReferenceScheme; ClaimScope remains separate. `FrameworkOrganizationDesignProposal` uses that description as its EntityOfConcern and proposes candidate pattern-family, dependency, publication, and access relations in one ClaimGraph. The proposal is the current result. No future framework entity, actual architecture, architecture description, dated Work, or production relation is asserted.

#### Coverage and acceptance slice

The proposal's medication-review coverage criterion names the pattern families whose representation is necessary for that declared use. One constraint claim node names the covered relation-family refs with exact kinds, that admitted use, and the coverage criterion. The authoring WorkPlan separately cites an acceptance target for review completion. C.33 uses the coverage node as comparator when evaluating proposal coverage; the WorkPlan target does not replace the criterion.

#### Empirical-grounding and use-frame stress slice

The intended-result description has a separately obtaining `EpistemeEmpiricalGroundingRelation` to `MedicationReviewTeam@Hospital-A`, an A.1-admitted holon, covering the exact supported claim subgraph. The holon is not an episteme identity slot. A request to rely instead on a consortium first rechecks the empirical-grounding relation and evidence, effective ReferenceScheme, ClaimScope, and any independently selected BoundedModelUseStructure. Changing only the empirical ground changes that relation; changing the ClaimGraph, EntityOfConcern, or effective scheme identifies another episteme. F.9 opens only if an exact cross-context local-sense translation is actually current, not merely because the maintaining organization changed.

#### Post-PFAD dependency slice

PFAD exists. The Core edition is available and relevant now, so its dependency position has exact value and kind refs and no acquisition condition. A publication carrier is missing but retained for later use, so its position has no value refs, has an acquisition-condition description, and does not block current pattern drafting. A missing source pack marked `currentForNextAuthoringUse` blocks the next use and opens the stated return. Availability never stands for relevance.

#### Framework-evolution slice

A new controlled-environment study changes the admissible nutrient range used only by `HC.NutrientMonitoring`. `G.2` first revises the source-use decision and preserves the displaced source reading. `E.4.PFR` identifies the nutrient pattern, its source-reuse relation, and its dependent examples as the affected set. `E.21` evaluates the revised pattern body; `E.23` governs repeated improvement of that pattern edition; `G.11` governs currentness, telemetry, and deprecation or supersession of exposed editions. Unaffected climate-control and harvest-feedback patterns remain current. `E.4.PFAD` stays closed while framework family, pattern split, relation structure, publication or access architecture, and dependency boundary remain unchanged; a change to one of those decisions makes PFAD current again.

### E.4.DPF:6 - Bias-Annotation


The first drift is source-summary confidence: a summary feels sufficient because it names the right domain terms. The repair is to turn sources into a `G.2` source pack with adopted and rejected payload, then carry that payload into pattern solutions and examples.

The second drift is publication-carrier-first authoring. The repair is not to delay publication forever; it is to publish after the architecture decision, relation records, and source-return notes are recoverable.

### E.4.DPF:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Passing condition |
| --- | --- |
| CC-DPF.1 Use frame declared | Intended reader, first use, non-use boundary, effective ReferenceScheme, ClaimScope, and qualification window are named; an optional selected BoundedModelUseStructure appears only when its organization changes interpretation. |
| CC-DPF.2 Source pack present | `G.2` source basis includes adopted payload, rejected alternatives, examples, claim status, and currentness notes. |
| CC-DPF.3 Architecture decision present | `E.4.PFAD` or direct `E.9` plus `C.32.PAD` records purpose, domain or local problem-and-solution architecture, pattern split, relation structure, publication and access architecture, dependency boundary, and consequences. Decision relation, decision episteme, architecture decision record, relation records, edition dependencies, package architecture, and publications remain separate. |
| CC-DPF.4 Names prepared | Durable public names and abbreviations have `F.18` name-card work or are explicitly provisional source aliases. |
| CC-DPF.5 Carriers admitted | Any all-in-one carrier, skill pack, MCP-backed access route, graph, generated set, source summary, or transformed view used as evidence has `C.33`, `C.34`, or `C.35` treatment. |
| CC-DPF.6 Patterns drafted through E.8 | Pattern bodies carry recognition text for recurring domain or local problem situations, positive SoTA-informed solution moves, worked cases, known failure modes or local anti-patterns, checklist, SoTA-Echoing, and relations. Skeletons, prompt seeds, and compressed design notes are named as seeds rather than treated as normal DPF patterns. |
| CC-DPF.7 Quality and refresh routes present | `E.22` frames evaluation purpose when needed; `E.4.DPF.DA` package adequacy, `E.21` pattern quality, `E.23` improvement, and `G.11` refresh routes are named with edition or refresh conditions. Public, teaching, enterprise, or reliance-bearing DPF publication names the checked pattern-quality basis or remains `seedOnly`. |
| CC-DPF.8 Carrier structure-account visible | Readme, Preface, or equivalent practical-use carrier says which domain or local problem-and-solution structures the framework exposes, for whom, what is foregrounded, deliberately coarsened, abstracted, omitted, deferred, or lost, and where source, pattern, evidence, or relation return happens. |
| CC-DPF.9 Problem-solving primacy | The DPF tells which typical domain or local problems it helps solve, which known failure modes it blocks, and which source-grounded SoTA solution moves it offers. If it mainly provides vocabulary, ontology, commentary, or conversation guidance, it is not yet a reliance-bearing DPF. |
| CC-DPF.10 Current first result | The selected result is exactly the C.2.1 pre-PFAD proposal, E.4.PFAD architecture decision, post-existence C.30.AD description use, or C.2.1 post-PFAD dependency description under its stated condition; each result has its own direct governor and receiving use. |
| CC-DPF.11 C.2.1 proposal constitution | Intended-result description identity is its exact ClaimGraph, current A.15.2 WorkPlan EntityOfConcern, and effective ReferenceScheme; proposal identity is its exact ClaimGraph, that description EntityOfConcern, and effective ReferenceScheme. ClaimScope, empirical grounding, model-use structure, provenance, publication, and edition relations remain separate. |
| CC-DPF.12 Subject organization | Candidate organization is recoverable from typed claim nodes and proposed subject relations; no future entity, episteme-per-claim wrapper, or proposal-document meta-structure substitutes for it. |
| CC-DPF.13 Coverage distinction | A coverage constraint node has family ref-kind pairs, one admitted use, and one criterion; any WorkPlan acceptance target remains separate. |
| CC-DPF.14 Architecture and project-use boundary | C.33 compares with a declared present comparator; C.30.AD starts only after the framework entity, exact architecture relation, and selected structures exist. `ArchitectureDescriptionUseCard@Project` is retrieval-only; actual project locality also names the exact composite project `U.Work` and separately obtaining description-use relation. |
| CC-DPF.15 Dependency description and branches | Description identity is the exact dependency ClaimGraph, current authoring WorkPlan EntityOfConcern, and effective ReferenceScheme; ClaimScope and optional model-use/grounding relations remain separate. Its minimum local claim nodes are Core edition, source basis, and PFAD; Core edition and PFAD are available with exact value-kind refs. Available nodes have exact value and kind without acquisition condition; missing nodes have acquisition condition without value; relevance remains independent. |
| CC-DPF.16 Method, Work, result, edition, and publication separation | Exact authoring Method and MethodDescription, WorkPlan, dated authoring Work and A.6.1 application, every result entity/direct relation/receiving use, framework episteme editions, EpistemeEditionRelation, package architecture, publication occurrence, form, carrier, and access use are independently recoverable. Neither step order nor package/file placement creates any of them. |
| CC-DPF.17 CGUS restraint | The numbered routes remain Plain guidance. Any claimed A.22.CGUS has independently recovered identity, constituents, obtaining relations, constraints, multiple admissible continuations, stops/returns, and a separate demonstrative episteme; imperative prose or a mantra is insufficient. |

### E.4.DPF:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | What fails | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Checklist promoted to framework | Local tips are published as a principle framework without source, relation, or quality work. | Treat the checklist as local process text until `G.2`, `E.8`, `E.4.PFR`, and `E.21` are satisfied. |
| Source summary as SoTA | A literature summary replaces adopted and rejected source payload. | Build a `G.2` source pack and carry each load-bearing source into solution, boundary, or example text. |
| Ontology catalog as framework | The package classifies the domain or defines terms, but it does not tell a practitioner what typical problem is live or what SoTA solution move avoids a known failure. | Keep ontology as support material; draft or repair DPF patterns around problem frames, positive solution moves, worked cases, anti-patterns, and refresh. |
| Publication carrier as architecture | Publication occurrence, form, presentation carrier, package boundary, or access route is treated as framework episteme, edition continuity, package architecture, relation membership, or truth. | Recover E.4.PFAD architecture decisions, E.4.PFR relations/dependencies, C.2.1 framework identity, and E.24.PUB publication occurrence/form/carrier separately before relying on the exposed content. |
| Invisible framework story | A DPF carrier reads as a neutral list of principles, but the reader cannot tell what source or domain structures were selected, why this route is for them, what was deliberately coarsened, abstracted, omitted, or left to source return, or whether the carrier is a second-step coarsening after an architecture description or view. | Add a short carrier structure-account in the readme, Preface, or equivalent carrier, then evaluate it through `E.4.DPF.DA` rather than scattering explanation into every pattern body. |
| Generated candidate authority | Search or LLM output becomes the framework because it is fluent. | Use `C.35` for admission, then decide candidate selection through `E.4.PFAD` or `C.32`. |
| Skeleton carrier as DPF | A file has a ToC, headings, and very short pattern-shaped sections, but readers still cannot apply the patterns without reconstructing the missing guidance from the DRR or source notes. | Keep it as `seedOnly`; harden each DPF pattern through `E.8`, evaluate through `E.21`, and only then assemble the user publication carrier. |
| Access carrier as framework | A skill pack, MCP endpoint, retrieval route, or assistant integration is treated as the framework itself because it is what agents call. | Record it as an access carrier through `E.4.PFR`, expose framework edition and currentness refs, and route generated, tool, evidence, currentness, or work claims to their governing patterns. |
| Future framework fabricated | A pre-PFAD record points to the absent framework or claims its actual structures. | Create a current intended-result description and one proposal episteme; wait for PFAD and realization before architecture-description use. |
| Claim wrapper collection | Every candidate organization claim becomes another episteme. | Keep typed claim nodes in the proposal's one ClaimGraph unless a separately grounded claim episteme has its own EoC and use. |
| Proposal layout as subject organization | Headings or ClaimGraph organization are treated as the proposed framework organization. | Recover described position kinds, proposed subject relation signatures, constraints, invariants, dependency directions, alternatives, basis, and questions. |
| Coverage and acceptance union | One field mixes coverage criterion with WorkPlan acceptance target. | Keep the coverage node complete and cite the plan target separately. |
| Availability as relevance | A missing dependency is assumed blocking, or an available dependency is assumed current for next use. | Fill availability and use relevance independently; only the exact combined state determines the next-use consequence. |
| Grounding or context as identity | A grounding holon, organization, project label, package boundary, or bare context word is inserted into episteme identity or used to force sameness. | Keep C.2.1 identity at ClaimGraph, EntityOfConcern, and effective ReferenceScheme; use separate empirical-grounding, ClaimScope, model-use, project-Work, and exact cross-context translation relations only when their predicates obtain. |
| Authoring order as Method, Work, result, or CGUS | Numbered guidance, arrows, coordination rows, or document order is used as proof that a Method, Work occurrence, result relation, or conditional structure exists. | Recover the exact authoring Method/MethodDescription, dated Work and application, direct result/use relation, or independently selected A.22.CGUS; otherwise keep the sequence Plain. |

Adoption risk tripwires:

| Risk | Early repair |
| --- | --- |
| Public name settles before the kind is settled. | Keep the intake name as a source alias and route durable naming through `F.18`. |
| Generated or searched material is trusted because it uses familiar FPF words. | Admit the carrier through `C.35`, then decide selected use through `E.4.PFAD`, `E.4.PFR`, or the pattern governing that use. |
| Core, domain, or local edition changes but old users keep following stale guidance. | Add dependency, compatibility, migration, deprecation, supersession, and refresh records through `E.4.PFR` and `G.11`. |
| Enterprise evidence is confidential or proprietary. | Publish a safe local carrier while keeping internal source packs, examples, role assignments, and approval evidence under an explicit local stewardship assignment. |
| No assigned steward can answer whether the framework is current, adopted, or broken in use. | Assign steward roles for the framework edition, source pack, relation records, local publication, quality evidence, and refresh plan. |
| Reader errors and skipped records are treated as training noise. | Treat repeated misuse as adoption telemetry and route it to `E.23` improvement or `G.11` refresh. |
| Compatibility debt hides behind a version label or package manifest. | Record the impacted relations, compatibility boundary, migration work, and blocked runtime or build reading in `E.4.PFR`. |

### E.4.DPF:9 - Consequences

Using the exact authoring Method and MethodDescription while keeping dated Work, results, receiving uses, editions, relations, package architecture, and publication objects explicit adds overhead before a local framework becomes durable. That overhead prevents hidden source loss, hidden Core change, hidden relation semantics, false production or membership claims, and hidden currentness debt.

The pattern also makes local publication more useful. Readers get a coherent publication or practical-use carrier, while maintainers can still inspect the framework edition, source pack, relation records, decision records, and quality route.

### E.4.DPF:10 - Rationale

Domain and local frameworks are not mere subsets of FPF. They are FPF-grounded framework editions for declared domain or local use frames. They need domain source work, FPF authoring discipline, architecture decisions, relation records, quality loops, and refresh routes.

Its contribution is one E.8/A.3.2 framework-authoring MethodDescription plus precise Plain selection and branching guidance. The text does not claim a reusable condition-governed structure by prose; when an A.22.CGUS is genuinely current, it is separately admitted with exact conditions, continuations, stops, and demonstration. Every produced or selected result still needs an exact receiving use and the direct pattern governing that result or use relation.

### E.4.DPF:11 - SoTA-Echoing

| Claim | Exact source ref and status | Pattern content changed | Adoption status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A DPF needs one coordinated authoring method and Plain guidance that keep source use, architecture settlement, pattern methods, relation and edition records, reader access, evaluation, improvement, and currentness distinct but connected. | Current FPF `G.2`, `E.4.PFAD`, `E.8`, `E.4.PFR`, `E.11`, `E.17`, `E.4.DPF.DA`, `E.21`, `E.23`, and `G.11`, current governing practice line for this pattern. | The E.4.DPF MethodDescription, proportional-apparatus ladder, local repair map, exact first-result branches, carrier boundaries, and quality and currentness exits coordinate these separately governed objects rather than importing one external framework-development lifecycle. | Adopt as the governing line. Recheck this row when any named FPF pattern changes its governed object, result, or boundary; an external source does not override the direct FPF owner by vocabulary similarity. |
| Language artifacts and their examples co-evolve, and missing examples weaken practical use and evolution work. | Zhang, Struber, Hebig, `Development and Evolution of Xtext-based DSLs on GitHub: An Empirical Investigation`, arXiv:2501.19222, 2025 empirical study of 226 developed Xtext languages across 18 application domains, `https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19222`. | The source-pack, pattern-drafting, worked-case, heterogeneous-transfer, relation-and-edition, and local-repair steps keep examples and related artifacts current with the framework instead of publishing only names or definitions. | Adapt the observed co-evolution pressure. The study concerns software DSL repositories and grammar-driven or metamodel-driven development; it does not make a DPF a language grammar, parser, metamodel, or code-generator project. |
| Reusable core and domain variation need explicit dependency, migration, tooling, and adoption work rather than clone-and-own packages. | Nazar, `Software Product Line Engineering: Adoption, Tooling and AI Era Challenges`, arXiv:2605.21353, 2026 single-author survey preprint synthesizing SPLE foundations, adoption models, tooling, variability-aware DevOps, empirical gaps, and AI-era challenges, `https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.21353`. | Architecture decision, E.4.PFR dependency and compatibility relations, Core-to-DPF direction, proportional carrier separation, and edition-change repair keep FPF Core, domain frameworks, and local frameworks distinct and migratable. | Adapt reusable-core, variation, migration, and adoption concerns. The source is software-product-line specific and survey-level; feature models, lifecycle schemes, product-line economics, and software tooling do not become default DPF ontology or authoring order. |
| Pattern candidates need systematic validation pressure and use in practice, not only memorable problem-solution prose or a rule-of-three claim. | Riehle, Harutyunyan, Barcomb, `Pattern Discovery and Validation Using Scientific Research Methods`, arXiv:2107.06065, 2021 method paper with three exploratory studies, `https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06065`; Iba, `Pattern Languages as Media for the Creative Society`, arXiv:1308.1178, 2013 historical lineage for pattern languages as practice media, `https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1178`. | E.8 drafting, E.21 evaluation, heterogeneous cases, seed-versus-reliance boundary, and E.23 improvement replace rule-of-three confidence with declared FPF evaluation and repair. Local mantras remain attentional aids to a full Solution rather than substitutes for pattern validation. | Adapt qualitative survey, action-research, case-study, and practice-media pressure where suitable. The 2021 studies are exploratory and the 2013 paper is lineage, not current governing evidence; current FPF evaluation patterns decide adequacy for the declared use. |

**External-source currentness front.** The current-FPF row above keeps its own exact recheck trigger. Apply each external-source decision only within the role and qualification basis below. When the named smallest change occurs, use `G.11` to reopen only the affected authoring step, case, boundary, or adopted decision and return the changed source role to `G.2`; publication of a newer item alone is not a material trigger.

| External source | Currentness role and qualification/version basis | Smallest material reopen condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Xtext empirical study | `current empirical input` for language-artifact/example co-evolution, qualified through the cited 2025 study edition, its 226 Xtext-language repositories and 18 application domains, and the explicit limit to software DSL evidence. | A later comparable empirical study contradicts the co-evolution pressure or identifies a different example/usability/evolution failure that would change the source-pack, pattern-drafting, worked-case, heterogeneous-transfer, relation/edition, or local-repair step. |
| SPLE survey | `current survey input`, qualified through the cited 2026 arXiv preprint edition and its survey-level software-product-line scope; feature-model and lifecycle ontology remain rejected for default DPF use. | A corrected, withdrawn, or superseding survey or systematic review materially changes reusable-core dependency, migration, tooling, adoption, or evolution practice used by PFAD, E.4.PFR, Core-to-DPF direction, carrier separation, or edition-change repair. |
| Pattern-validation method paper | `current validation-practice input`, qualified through the cited 2021 paper edition and its three exploratory-study limit. | Replication, comparative validation research, or a changed practice line materially alters the need for qualitative survey, action research, heterogeneous cases, seed-versus-reliance separation, or repair pressure in E.8, E.21, or E.23. |
| Iba practice-media paper | `lineage`, qualified to the cited 2013 edition only for the historical pattern-language-as-practice-media rationale; it is not current validation evidence. | A corrected or replacement lineage source changes that rationale, or current practice-media evidence materially changes how worked cases, use in practice, or local mantras support rather than replace full pattern validation. |
