## A.6.3.NAR - Structure-to-Narrative Rendering

> **Type:** Specialization pattern
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative unless explicitly marked informative

### A.6.3.NAR:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when exact source episteme `X` must be used to construct exact receiving narrative episteme `Y` about the same exact EntityOfConcern by ordering selected source structure into a sequential account for a declared reader or listener use. A scientific model, graph, architecture view, evidence set, event stream, proof field, source pack, publication, file, or display may be designated by `X`, cited as an additional governed input, or make `X` available; none is the source endpoint merely by type or location. The readable narrative, its page, audio, file, or publication form is likewise not `Y` unless the claim-bearing whole independently passes C.2.1 constitution.

**Governed construction.** NAR specializes the exact A.6.3 declaration `n : X -> Y`. Before stating it, recover for both endpoints exact claim content, exact EntityOfConcern, and effective `U.ReferenceScheme`. Then state the claim-content construction, same-EntityOfConcern condition, relation between schemes, ordering rule, preserved and lost structure, prohibited strengthening, applicability, and return. Exact correspondence relations may be cited when the construction depends on them; correspondence does not relax the same-EntityOfConcern rule.

Plain starting vocabulary:

| Term | Plain meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `source basis` | Shorthand for exact source episteme `X`, plus only those additional exact source epistemes and governed relations that `n` actually cites. A source set, model, graph, event stream, source pack, publication occurrence, form, or carrier does not substitute for `X`. |
| `selected source structures` | Exact governed relations, constraints, events, mechanisms, dependencies, conflicts, alternatives, or changes designated in `X` or in named additional source epistemes and needed by `n`. |
| `source-structure selection rationale` | Why these exact governed structures, rather than other possible structures, are needed for the declared reader or listener use. |
| `source temporal posture` | Whether the claims in the source basis concern retrospective or reverse-engineered actual structure or events, live unfolding, prospective planned structure, prospective fictional structure or canon, or a mixed case. |
| `rendering mediation mode` | Whether `n` uses exact source claims directly or depends on separately governed architecture-description, view, decision, telemetry, or correspondence claims. |
| `narrating or rendering worker` | The system that performs exact dated narrative-construction Work under an exact role assignment when actual work history matters. The worker, Work, method, operation bindings, and any production claim remain separate from `n`, `X`, and `Y`. |
| `reader or listener role` | The role and use whose interests constrain selection, ordering, recoverability, engagement, and return. This is narrower than a generic audience. |
| `reader-interest or use hypothesis` | The explicit claim about what the reader or listener needs to do with `Y` and which selected source structures serve that use. |
| `receiving narrative episteme` | Exact `Y`: a C.2.1 episteme whose claim content is arranged as the receiving sequential account. A readable form or carrier is only a neighbor. |
| `ordering rationale` | The exact sequence rule: event, causal, discovery, didactic, tension, traversal, or another declared order. |
| `source-basis return condition` | When the user returns to exact `X`, an exact additional source episteme or governed source relation, or a named receiving governor because `Y` no longer carries what the use needs. |
| `epiplexity question` | “How much selected source structure did this construction pull into an inspectable description for this observer and use?” NAR supplies the relation inputs; structural-information and evaluation patterns answer the value claim. |

**First useful move.** Name the C.2.1 identity triples of `X` and `Y`, then write one compact `StructureToNarrativeRenderingCase` that states `n : X -> Y`, selected source structures, selection rationale, temporal posture, mediation mode, reader-use hypothesis, exact ordering, preservation, foregrounding, loss, recoverability, admissible use, non-admissible use, and return. Add actual Work, exact correspondence, publication, form, carrier, viewpoint, grounding, evidence, or assurance only at its own trigger.

**What goes wrong if missed.** A fluent sequence, graph traversal, source pack, publication, or generated carrier becomes a substitute for `X`, `Y`, or an obtaining correspondence. Readers remember a story but cannot reconstruct the exact claims and relations that licensed it.

**What this buys.** Narrative ordering can help human use while exact endpoint identity, construction, preservation, loss, and return remain inspectable. The sequence does not become proof, authority, evidence, architecture, publication, `U.View`, or the selected source structure itself.

**Ordinary use.** For low-reliance teaching, orientation, or internal explanation, one compact case note is enough after `X`, `Y`, and `n` are recoverable. It still states what `Y` preserves, what it leaves behind, and when to return to exact sources.

**Reliance-facing use.** Use the **complete required narrative field set** when `Y` will guide architecture work, design decisions, policy communication, safety work, generated-output admission, external teaching, or cross-context reuse. The set keeps exact endpoints and construction, selected structures and rationale, temporal posture and mediation, worker when current, reader/use, ordering, preservation/foregrounding/loss, recoverability, admissible and non-admissible uses, and return recoverable. Field presence does not itself authorize reliance.

**Not this pattern when.** Use A.6.3.CR for same-regime wording, A.6.3.RT when scheme transition rather than narrative order is primary, A.6.3.CSC for a narrower-use coarsened episteme, E.17.EFP for explanation adequacy on an existing face, and A.6.4 for changed EntityOfConcern. Carrier export, generated-output admission, publication, evidence, assurance, ethics, and work authorization remain with their direct governors.

### A.6.3.NAR:2 - Problem

Projects often need narrative because selected source structures are too tangled for a reader to use directly. A mechanism, architecture, model, evidence set, or event graph may need a beginning, order, tension, action, update point, or learning path before humans can follow it.

Without `A.6.3.NAR`:

1. narrative is treated as style polish after the real work is done;
2. narrative is treated as a lossy summary even when sequence-making is the main representational move;
3. selected source structure, order, event model, and lost relations disappear behind fluent prose;
4. engagement is allowed to raise confidence, authority, ethical permission, or policy force without a direct governing pattern;
5. generated narrative output is trusted because it is coherent or dramatic;
6. teaching material can be smuggled into pattern bodies instead of being kept as a separate test-run publication carrier or ordinary publication carrier.

### A.6.3.NAR:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Selected source structure vs human sequence | A reader often needs an ordered path, while the selected source structure may be a graph, mechanism, option set, architecture, or evidence field rather than a line. |
| Engagement vs truth boundary | Tension, viewpoint, protagonist, and pacing can help attention, but they do not widen truth, evidence, authority, ethical permission, or admissible downstream use. |
| Compression vs recoverability | A narrative foregrounds some structure and leaves other structure behind. The useful loss must be visible. |
| Event comprehension vs non-event structure | Some selected source structures involve events and actions; others involve dependencies, constraints, alternatives, or architectures. The pattern must support both without forcing a fiction model. |
| Domain richness vs Core economy | Narratology, storycraft, cognitive narrative research, science communication, NLG, and teaching practice are rich, but most of their vocabulary belongs in domain narrative source packs or local and domain frameworks rather than FPF Core. |

### A.6.3.NAR:4 - Solution

First establish exact A.6.3 construction `n : X -> Y`:

1. identify exact source episteme `X` and receiving narrative episteme `Y` independently by claim content, EntityOfConcern, and effective `U.ReferenceScheme`;
2. require the same exact EntityOfConcern; changed concern exits to A.6.4;
3. state how exact claims in `X` and any named additional source epistemes construct the sequential claim content of `Y`;
4. state how the endpoint effective schemes relate, the exact ordering rule, preserved content, foregrounded content, admitted loss, prohibited strengthening, and applicability;
5. cite every exact governed correspondence relation used by the construction; a graph edge, architecture view, source-set row, publication, or similar content does not make one obtain.

If the supposed receiving item has no recoverable claim content, exact EntityOfConcern, or effective reference scheme, it is candidate prose, a publication form, or a carrier—not `Y`; stop before asserting NAR. A valid `n` constructs a candidate episteme but does not make `Y` a `U.View`. E.17.0 conformance decides that separately.

Create a `StructureToNarrativeRenderingCase` only after this boundary passes. The case is local review content, not a new U-kind, relation signature, or identity record:

```text
StructureToNarrativeRenderingCase:
  sourceEpistemeRef: X
  receivingNarrativeEpistemeRef: Y
  viewingConstructionRefOrStatement: n : X -> Y
  additionalSourceEpistemeRefs?:
  exactCorrespondenceRelationRefs?:
  selectedSourceStructureRefs:

  engagementOrMotivationClaim?:
  admissibleUse:
  nonAdmissibleDownstreamUse:
  neighboringPatternExits:
```

The references to `X` and `Y` resolve to their complete C.2.1 identities; the case does not add identity slots. `narrativeConstructionWorkRef` is present only when actual history matters. A system performs that dated Work under A.15.1; the morphism does not. Source epistemes, parameters, methods, tools, and `Y` participate through exact direct relations or A.6.1 bindings. If the Work first constitutes `Y` and inception matters, A.15.PROD governs that separate claim.

Publication remains separate. E.24.PUB identifies any occurrence that makes exact selected episteme `Y` available to a declared audience and bounded use through an exact publication form and `U.PresentationCarrier`. The publication occurrence, form, carrier, audience, and readable sequence neither constitute `Y` nor establish `n`.

Use this unfolding block when selected source structure must be carried into a reader-facing sequence with explicit loss and return:

```text
NarrativeUnfoldingStructureBlock:
  sourceEpistemeRef: X
  structureBeingRenderedRef:
  unfoldingStructureBeingRenderedRef?:
  narrativeOrderingStructureRef:
  readerActSequenceHypothesis?:
  receivingNarrativeEpistemeRef: Y
  preservedStructure:
  lostOrCoarsenedStructure:
  narrativeStructureUseReturnCondition:
  blockedOverread: narrative sequence is not X, its selected structure, proof, decision, work sequence, publication, or gate
```

`structureBeingRenderedRef` names an independently governed structure designated by `X`; it does not replace `X`. `narrativeOrderingStructureRef` names the ordering rule or selected sequence structure used for reader understanding. `receivingNarrativeEpistemeRef` names `Y`, not its form or carrier. These are different positions.

`NarrativeUnfoldingStructureBlock` is a local A.22.CGUS `U.Structure` specialization block only when that direct pattern's admission and identity tests pass. It is not a root U-kind, workflow, proof, architecture decision, evidence record, publication permission, or automatic description of every NAR case. Use `unfoldingStructureBeingRenderedRef` only when the exact source structure is itself a constraint-governed unfolding structure.

Work in this order:

1. Identify exact `X`, exact `Y`, and their C.2.1 identity triples.
2. State `n : X -> Y`, same exact EntityOfConcern, endpoint scheme relation, claim construction, prohibited strengthening, and applicability.
3. Name each selected source structure, exact governor, and any additional source episteme or correspondence relation on which `n` depends.
4. State source temporal posture, source-structure selection rationale, and reader-interest or use hypothesis. If these remain only in intuition, a prompt, or finished prose, keep the output candidate-only.
5. Name direct-source-claims, architecture-mediated, or mixed mediation. Architecture descriptions, views, decisions, selected structures, and telemetry remain separate governed objects.
6. Recover actual narrating Work, system, role assignment, method, and bindings only when that history matters.
7. Choose and state the ordering rationale: event, causal, discovery, didactic, tension, graph traversal, architecture-decision, live-commentary, prospective-scenario, source-publication order, or another exact rule.
8. State preserved, foregrounded, coarsened, and lost structure, plus recoverability and return to exact `X` or governed source relations.
9. If the live question is how much structure was pulled into `Y`, cite the structural-information or epiplexity result rather than answering with fluency. Architecture-relevant use routes to C.33; non-architecture narrative evaluation stays with its domain governor, A.19.ECS, and C.16 as applicable.
10. Add event-model support when events, actions, mechanisms, goals, obstacles, state updates, or change are part of the use.
11. Keep engagement or motivation as a bounded use claim. Route persuasion, harm, affected parties, policy influence, bias, value conflict, evidence, and assurance to D.1–D.5, A.10, or B.3 as applicable.
12. Close with admissible use, non-admissible downstream use, source or governing-pattern return, and neighboring exits.

#### A.6.3.NAR:4.1 - Ordinary and claim-bearing cases

Ordinary cases can stay lightweight after exact `X`, exact `Y`, and `n : X -> Y` are recoverable. An internal explanation, teaching example, or orientation narrative then needs only selected source structure, sequence rule, visible loss, admissible use, and return to exact source episteme or governed source relations.

Claim-bearing cases need the fuller record. A case is claim-bearing when the narrative will be used for design, architecture, policy, safety, public science communication, generated-output admission, cross-context reuse, assurance-facing training, or a disputed interpretation.

#### A.6.3.NAR:4.2 - Same-EntityOfConcern and correspondence-mediated profiles

Every NAR construction is same-EntityOfConcern: exact `X` and `Y` designate the same entity. Similar content or a declared correspondence does not relax this rule. If the narrative concerns another entity, use A.6.4 and state its retargeting relation.

Use the **direct-source-claims** profile when `n` constructs `Y` from exact claims in `X` and fixed configuration. A situation, event stream, domain model, proof dependency field, evidence set, fictional canon, or source pack can contribute only after exact `X` claims about it or exact additional source epistemes and governed relations are named. The raw object, graph, set, or pack is not the source endpoint.

Use the **correspondence-mediated** profile when `n` depends on exact governed relations among `X`, additional exact source epistemes, or their designated structures. Recover each direct correspondence, realization, trace, equivalence, or consistency relation under its owner and cite the exact assertion episteme when the construction uses a claim about that occurrence. A C.34 record is used only when C.34 governs the exact correspondence current for this use; it is not a generic cure for dissimilar endpoints.

#### A.6.3.NAR:4.2.1 - Direct and architecture-mediated routes

In the direct route, the exact source episteme states or designates the source situation, event structure, proof dependencies, canon claims, or source-pack claims that `n` orders. Viewpoint discipline may help, but `X`, `Y`, and `n` remain the central objects.

In the architecture-mediated route, one exact architecture-description, architecture-view, decision, candidate-structure, or telemetry episteme participates as `X` or as an explicitly named additional source episteme. Independently recover any selected A.22 structures, world-side holons, decisions, relations, or telemetry occurrences that its claims designate. The return chain is `Y` to exact source episteme(s), then through their governed designations to exact structures or occurrences when those are current. Each selection, coarsening, abstraction, omission, ordering, and correspondence remains explicit under C.33, C.34, C.32.*, and the direct architecture-description or decision governors. NAR governs only `n`.

In either route, the temporal posture matters. A historical reconstruction, live commentary, prospective project narrative, and fictional continuation can all be narrative epistemes, but they have different source claims, evidence and uncertainty boundaries, order, and return conditions. A system may perform narrative-construction Work; the source or narrative episteme does not act.

#### A.6.3.NAR:4.3 - Ordering rationale

The ordering rationale is not decoration. It is the structure-to-sequence rule.

Common ordering rationales:

| Ordering rationale | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| Event order | The selected source structure is a sequence of happenings or state changes. |
| Causal order | The reader must understand mechanism, dependency, intervention, or consequence. |
| Discovery order | The narrative teaches how a claim, design, or explanation was found. |
| Didactic order | The source basis is reordered so a learner can build prerequisites and reconstruct the selected source structures later. |
| Tension order | The narrative preserves conflicts, trade-offs, obstacles, failed attempts, or unresolved alternatives. |
| Traversal rule | The source basis is a graph, architecture, relation set, or option field and the narrative follows a declared path through it. |

If the source basis only changes carrier form, file format, export layout, OCR extraction, or byte order, this pattern is not open. Carrier serialization alone is not narrative rendering.

#### A.6.3.NAR:4.4 - Event model, viewpoint, and agency

If the narrative asks readers to understand events, actions, mechanisms, or change, state the event-model support. At minimum, name the event or mechanism type, participating holons or agents when present, causal or dependency links, update points, and what the narrative asks the reader to predict or revise.

If viewpoint, narrator, focalized object, protagonist, or agency choices affect understanding, keep them in domain narrative vocabulary unless a direct FPF governing pattern is live. In FPF Core, the reusable claim is simpler: the viewpoint choice foregrounds some selected source structure and hides or weakens another structure for a declared use.

#### A.6.3.NAR:4.5 - Engagement, ethics, and assurance boundary

Engagement is a real use claim, but it is not truth or permission.

When an engagement or motivation claim matters, state:

- intended effect for the declared use;
- selected source structure that may not be distorted for that effect;
- affected reader, listener, group, or decision context when relevant;
- non-admissible uses that would overread the narrative;
- direct governing pattern for ethical, evidence, assurance, or policy claims.

Use `D.1` for ethical value-frame entry, `D.2` through `D.4` for multilevel conflict and decision use, `D.5` for bias, human impact, or ethical assurance, `A.10` for evidence, and `B.3` for assurance. Narrative engagement never grants moral permission by itself.

#### A.6.3.NAR:4.6 - Reopen, lower, and return rule

A NAR case stays admissible only while exact `X`, exact `Y`, `n : X -> Y`, selected source structures, intended use, ordering rationale, loss, and source or governing-pattern return still match the receiving use. When one changes, repair the smallest affected object and its dependent claims before reuse; do not turn NAR into a general narrative monitor.

| Trigger | Required move |
| --- | --- |
| Exact `X`, additional source epistemes, or selected governed structures change | Reidentify the changed episteme when a C.2.1 discriminator changed; restate `n`, preservation, foregrounding, loss, and return. Use C.33 only for architecture-relevant captured/lost structure and G.2 only for source-pack claims; lower use until exact source return is restored. |
| Intended reader or listener use becomes stronger, broader, or more reliance-facing | Lower the narrative to orientation-only use until the case is repaired; route publication or audience-unit claims to `E.17` or `E.17.AUD`, and route evidence, assurance, ethics, or policy force to `A.10`, `B.3`, or `D.1` through `D.5`. |
| Ordering rationale or traversal rule changes | Reopen the ordering field and visible-loss account; use `A.6.3.RT` if the representation scheme changed, `A.6.3.CSC` if the source basis was deliberately coarsened for narrower use, and NAR only when selected source structure is still being ordered into a narrative path. |
| Return to exact `X`, exact governed source relations, or the direct next governor is missing, stale, or unreachable | Lower downstream use and refresh that exact return before reliance-facing use; use G.11 when currentness or freshness is the live defect. |
| Generated output, source-basis plan, schema, or admission result changes | Return to `C.35` for generated-carrier admission and `G.2` for source-pack claims; reopen NAR only after the source-basis-to-narrative relation, captured or lost structure, and correspondence obligations are again explicit. |
| Domain narrative vocabulary, source-pack basis, or relevant narrative, NLG, or cognitive SoTA changes the meaning of a relied-on narrative field | Refresh the domain vocabulary or source-pack basis first; lower any NAR claim that depended on the old vocabulary or source-basis anchor until the field meaning is replayable. |
| Downstream use requires stronger evidence, assurance, ethics, publication, or work authority than the NAR case carries | Keep NAR as a representation relation only; route the stronger claim to `A.10`, `B.3`, `D.1` through `D.5`, `E.17`, or the direct work or decision governing pattern, and mark that downstream use non-admissible until that governing pattern admits the stronger claim. |
| Correspondence or preservation claim weakens after repair | Use `C.34` only for the weakened correspondence that remains; use `C.33` for captured and lost architecture-relevant structures, use the domain evaluation pattern for non-architecture epiplexity, and lower any downstream use that required stronger sameness. |

### A.6.3.NAR:5 - Archetypal Grounding

Tell: A.6.3.NAR constructs exact narrative episteme `Y` from exact source episteme `X` by one declared ordering rule while preserving source return. It is not a general story-writing pattern, and selected source structure, form, or carrier is not an endpoint.

#### A.6.3.NAR:5.1 - Scientific mechanism narrative

A chemistry paper has calculations, candidate mechanisms, failed synthesis attempts, and an unresolved tension between theory and experiment. The narrative uses discovery order: failed attempts, structural clue, revised mechanism, new experiment, remaining uncertainty.

Exact source episteme `ChemistryMechanism-X` states the candidate-mechanism, failed-attempt, experiment, and unresolved-tension claims about one exact reaction case under its effective scheme. Exact receiving narrative episteme `ChemistryDiscovery-Y` concerns the same case under its narrative scheme. `DiscoveryNarrativization : X -> Y` orders the exact selected claims, preserves the candidate and failed-attempt relations, foregrounds discovery sequence, omits full calculation detail, prohibits proof overread, and returns to `X` before mechanism-proof use. The calculations and files are not `X`; the paper form and carrier are not `Y`.

This is not only conservative retextualization because ordering and tension carry the use. It is not proof because the narrative does not replace evidence.

#### A.6.3.NAR:5.2 - Architecture trade-off narrative

Exact architecture source episteme `ArchitectureTradeoff-X` states module, custody, placement, characteristic, and rejected-candidate claims about exact project system `S` under its effective architecture scheme. Exact narrative episteme `ArchitectureRationale-Y` concerns the same `S` under its narrative scheme. The independently selected candidate structures remain A.22 objects designated by `X`, not source endpoints.

`ArchitectureRationaleNarrativization : X -> Y` uses tension order, preserves candidate and trade-off relations, foregrounds the selected path, declares omitted alternatives and residuals, blocks implementation authority, and returns to exact `X` and its governed architecture relations. The route is prospective during choice and retrospective during reconstruction; publication, decision, and synthesis remain separate.

#### A.6.3.NAR:5.2.1 - Architecture narrative repair after source change

Later, one rejected candidate gains a new measurement basis and a placement constraint changes. The old narrative still tells a coherent tension story, but it no longer preserves the live candidate set. The repair is local: lower the old narrative to historical orientation, reopen the NAR case, replace the selected-source-structure refs and ordering rationale, and add a new source-basis or governing-pattern return condition pointing to the updated architecture description, decision record, or synthesis governing pattern.

The captured and lost structures move to `C.33`: old rejected-candidate relation preserved as history, new candidate-set relation captured, and obsolete measurement basis marked lost for current decision use. `C.34` may carry only the weakened correspondence that remains between the old narrative and the updated source. Implementation or decision use stays non-admissible until the architecture description, decision record, or synthesis governing pattern is repaired.

#### A.6.3.NAR:5.2.2 - Live unfolding event narrative

Exact live event-record episteme `MatchState-X` states current score, possession, tactical, role, momentum, and uncertainty claims about exact match `M` under its live-event scheme. Exact commentary episteme `LiveNarrative-Y` concerns the same `M`; `LiveNarrativization : X -> Y` orders those claims while the match unfolds. The match and event stream are not `X`; audio is a form/carrier, not `Y`.

The construction admits live orientation and prediction while preserving uncertainty; later analysis, statistics, rule disputes, injuries, or official-result use returns to exact `X` or exact later source epistemes and their governed evidence/publication relations. Provisional narrative claims are not settled event evidence.

#### A.6.3.NAR:5.3 - FPF seminar-route boundary

Exact FPF source-selection episteme `FPFSeminarSource-X` states the selected FPF claims and relation dependencies for a teaching use. Exact seminar-route episteme `FPFSeminarNarrative-Y` concerns the same FPF subject and orders those claims for learners under `SeminarNarrativization : X -> Y`; outlines, slides, scripts, and exercises are separate publication forms/carriers.

The probe evaluates `n`, its ordering, loss, reconstruction, admissible teaching use, and return. It is not narrative-quality evidence, proof that FPF is correct, publication permission, or permission to place teaching carriers inside Core pattern bodies.

A separate E.24.PUB occurrence may later make selected `Y` available through an exact teaching form and carrier. That occurrence does not constitute `Y`, establish `n`, or add the teaching material to this pattern body.

#### A.6.3.NAR:5.4 - Franchise-continuation storycraft probe boundary

Exact source episteme `CanonSelection-X` states the admitted continuity claims about the exact fictional work under an effective canon scheme; the local source pack, files, and publications remain separately governed inputs and access objects. Exact receiving episteme `ContinuationNarrative-Y` is independently constituted before NAR is asserted.

`ContinuationNarrativization : CanonSelection-X -> ContinuationNarrative-Y` states exact selection, ordering, foregrounding, loss, prohibited strengthening, and return to `X` or exact governed source-pack claims. Storycraft vocabulary, canon classification, generation method, rights, publication, and full quality evaluation stay outside Core; G.2 governs source-pack claims, C.35 generated candidates, and direct patterns govern agency, responsibility, evidence, and publication.

#### A.6.3.NAR:5.5 - Homotopy-theory explanation probe boundary

A teacher uses exact mathematical source episteme `HomotopySource-X`, made available by a separately identified publication occurrence, to construct exact sequential explanation episteme `HomotopyNarrative-Y` about the same mathematical EntityOfConcern. The publication form and carrier are not `X`; the explanation pages are not `Y` merely by readability.

`A.6.3.NAR` records the chosen sequence rule and visible loss: which mathematical structures remain reconstructible, which proof details or generalizations are deferred, and when the learner must return to formal mathematical statements. It does not certify the mathematical proof, replace the formal text, or turn analogy recall into understanding. Use mathematical-lens, proof, `G.2` source-use, evidence, publication, and teaching-evaluation governing patterns when those claims are live.

#### A.6.3.NAR:5.6 - Automated event-graph narrative

An LLM or NLG system receives exact source episteme `EventPlan-X`, whose claim content designates an event graph, agent goals, constraints, and domain schema, then performs dated generation Work that proposes a carrier for candidate narrative episteme `StoryScene-Y`. The graph and schema are not `X`, and generated prose is not `Y` until C.2.1 identity is recoverable.

NAR asserts `EventNarrativization : EventPlan-X -> StoryScene-Y` only after C.2.1 constitution and generated-output admission pass. It names exact selected event relations, ordering, preserved constraints, coarsened or hallucinated claims, prohibited strengthening, and return to `X`. Generation fluency supplies no authority; C.35, G.2, evidence, assurance, and publication remain separate.

### A.6.3.NAR:6 - Bias-Annotation

| Bias | How NAR counters it |
| --- | --- |
| Story-substitution bias | Requires selected source structure, preserved structure, lost structure, admissible use, and source-basis return condition before relying on the narrative. |
| Engagement-authority bias | Treats engagement as a declared-use claim and routes ethics, evidence, assurance, and policy force to their governing patterns. |
| Sequence-naturalization bias | Requires the ordering rationale instead of letting a fluent order look inevitable. |
| Carrier-serialization bias | Keeps file export, stream order, OCR, and layout changes outside NAR unless selected source structure is ordered into a narrative path. |
| Generated-fluency bias | Keeps generated narratives as carriers or candidates until source-basis relation, structure preservation, and governing-pattern routing are declared. |
| Narratology-import bias | Keeps narratology and storycraft vocabulary in domain source packs or local and domain frameworks, not as automatic FPF Core ontology. |

### A.6.3.NAR:7 - Conformance and counterexample replay

| Check | Pass condition |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-NAR-1` | Exact `X` and `Y` are independently identified by claim content, EntityOfConcern, and effective `U.ReferenceScheme`; no model, graph, source set, publication, form, carrier, stream, pack, or readable prose substitutes for either. |
| `CC-NAR-2` | Exact `n : X -> Y` states same EntityOfConcern, claim construction, endpoint scheme relation, ordering rule, preservation, foregrounding, loss, prohibited strengthening, applicability, and return. |
| `CC-NAR-3` | Every selected source structure, additional source episteme, and correspondence dependency resolves to its exact object and governor; adjacency or a graph edge does not make a relation obtain. |
| `CC-NAR-4` | Source-structure selection rationale and reader-interest or use hypothesis explain why the exact selected structures matter. |
| `CC-NAR-5` | Source temporal posture, mediation mode, intended reader/listener role and use, and ordering rationale are explicit. Actual narrating Work, system, role, method, bindings, and any inception claim are recovered separately when current. |
| `CC-NAR-6` | Preserved, foregrounded, coarsened, and lost structures are stated enough to block overread; recoverability returns to exact `X`, exact additional source epistemes, or exact governed source relations. |
| `CC-NAR-7` | Event-model support appears when events, mechanisms, goals, obstacles, or change are part of the use. |
| `CC-NAR-8` | Engagement remains a bounded effect claim and does not widen truth, evidence, assurance, policy force, ethical permission, or authority. |
| `CC-NAR-9` | Admissible use, non-admissible downstream use, and source or governing-pattern return are named. |
| `CC-NAR-10` | E.17.0 independently decides whether candidate `Y` is a `U.View`; E.24.PUB independently identifies any publication occurrence, form, carrier, audience, and bounded use. |
| `CC-NAR-11` | A reused case is locally repaired or lowered when endpoint identity, selected source claims, order, loss, use, correspondence, publication, or return changes. |

Counterexample replay:

| Case | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| Preserve vs retarget | Same exact EntityOfConcern permits NAR; a different narrated subject exits to A.6.4 even when the story is derived from `X`. |
| Same vs different scheme | Narrative order may be primary in either case; a material scheme change additionally opens RT, but scheme difference alone establishes neither `n` nor correspondence. |
| Candidate vs `U.View` | A valid narrative episteme and NAR construction can fail viewpoint conformance and remain a non-View candidate. |
| Source publication/form/carrier | A publication can make `X` available and a form/carrier can express it; none becomes `X`, and a narrative page or audio file is not `Y`. |
| Narrative order | Chronology, tension, or didactic order is one declared construction rule, not world-side event order, proof order, performed-Work order, or relation obtaining by presentation. |
| Controlled loss | If `Y` is usable only under a narrower-use loss-and-return card, coordinate CSC; NAR ordering alone does not make the loss admissible. |
| Grounded source, ungrounded narrative | Grounding of `X` or an evidence set designated by it does not ground `Y`; recover a separate exact `EpistemeEmpiricalGroundingRelation` for `Y` only when its own claims satisfy that rule. |
| Selected structure overread | An A.22 structure designated by `X` may be ordered by `n`; it is not `X`, `Y`, the narrating system, viewpoint, `U.View`, representation, publication, or narrative Work. |

After each bounded repair replay only its local counterexample; after all repairs run this complete table once. Do not restart the whole narrative audit after every correction.

### A.6.3.NAR:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | What fails | Repair move |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Good story as source replacement | The narrative is memorable, but later users cannot recover the selected source structure. | Fill the NAR case: selected source structures, preserved and lost structure, source-basis return condition, and non-admissible downstream use. |
| Tacit selection as narrative success | The worker or model picked some structures, but no one can explain why those structures serve this reader use. | Reconstruct the source-structure selection rationale and reader-interest hypothesis; keep the output orientation-only until this passes. |
| Sequence by habit | The author uses chronology, textbook order, or dramatic order without saying why that order preserves the source. | State the ordering rationale and what the chosen order hides. |
| Engagement as evidence | Reader attention, transportation, or emotional uptake is treated as stronger truth or permission. | Keep engagement as a declared-use effect; route evidence to `A.10`, assurance to `B.3`, and ethics to `D.1` through `D.5`. |
| Narratology word import | Terms such as plot, focalization, voice, protagonist, suspense, or narrator are used as Core FPF kinds. | Keep those terms in domain source packs or local and domain frameworks unless a later DRR admits a reusable Core distinction. |
| Generated narrative by fluency | LLM output is accepted because it reads coherently. | Use `C.35` for generated carrier admission, then apply NAR only to a declared source-to-narrative relation. |
| Teaching material inside pattern body | A seminar script or exercises are inserted into the pattern rather than testing the pattern. | Keep teaching material in a separate test-run publication carrier or teaching publication carrier; the pattern states the relation, checks, and source-basis return rule. |

### A.6.3.NAR:9 - Consequences

Positive consequences:

- Narrative becomes a reviewable exact episteme-to-episteme construction rather than ungoverned prose or a generic source-object-to-carrier edge.
- Readers can benefit from sequence, tension, viewpoint, and event support without losing source-basis return discipline.
- Generated and human-authored narratives receive the same source-structure checks before downstream use.
- FPF Core stays small while narrative-studies, narratology, NLG, pedagogy, and storycraft details can mature outside Core.

Costs and trade-offs:

- Authors must write a small relation note for reliance-facing narratives.
- Some attractive narratives will be downgraded to orientation-only use because selected source structure is not recoverable.
- Engagement claims can trigger ethics, evidence, or assurance governing patterns, which may slow publication but prevents persuasion from becoming hidden authority.

### A.6.3.NAR:10 - Rationale

Narrative is a powerful way to make structure usable by humans. It can order events, mechanisms, evidence, options, architecture decisions, and learning paths. That strength is also the risk: a well-formed narrative can make a source look simpler, more certain, more complete, or more ethically acceptable than it is.

The chosen Core pattern is therefore narrow. It does not make FPF a narratology, storycraft, teaching, or NLG framework. It governs one exact A.6.3 construction `n : X -> Y`: exact claims in independently constituted source episteme `X` are ordered into exact receiving narrative episteme `Y` about the same EntityOfConcern for declared use, while ordering, preservation, loss, applicability, and source return remain visible.

| Exact source or practice anchor | Adopt, adapt, or reject | Concrete NAR locus changed | Boundary and currentness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roald Hoffmann, "The Tensions of Scientific Storytelling" (American Scientist, 2014) | Adopt as practice-grounded evidence that scientific narratives often order calculations, attempts, mechanisms, unresolved theory and experiment tensions, and discoveries rather than merely decorate results. | Adds scientific mechanism and discovery-order worked slices; requires ordering rationale, unresolved tension, and source-basis return condition. | Hoffmann is used as science-storytelling practice grounding, not current empirical cognitive SoTA and not authority over FPF ethics. |
| Wolf Schmid, `Narratology: An Introduction` (2010), and Matei Chihaia, `Introductions to Narratology: Theory, Practice and the Afterlife of Structuralism` (2012) | Adapt Schmid's domain distinction between pre-narrative material, story, narrative, and presentation constitution, plus Chihaia's survey of narratology traditions, as domain vocabulary: source basis, selection, composition, ordering, viewpoint, and presentation matter. | Strengthens `orderingRationaleOrTraversalRule`, viewpoint loss, and the Core or domain boundary in the Solution and anti-patterns. | Fiction-bound narratology terms do not become FPF Core ontology unless a later DRR admits a reusable Core distinction. |

(2026) | Adopt for automated narrativization boundaries: content planning, story planning, grounding, schema constraints, repair, evaluation limits, and human interpretive agency must be explicit. | Adds generated event-graph worked slice, generated-fluency bias, and governing-pattern exits to `C.35`, `G.2`, evidence, and assurance governing patterns. | Current story-generation and tool-assisted narrative SoTA is used for domain automation duties. NAR does not make generated output authoritative. |

### A.6.3.NAR:12 - Relations

- **Specializes:** `A.6.3` as exact same-EntityOfConcern construction `n : X -> Y`; any correspondence dependency is exact and separately governed and never relaxes endpoint identity.
- **Coordinates with:** `A.6.3.CR` for same-regime textual re-expression, `A.6.3.RT` for representation-scheme transition, `A.6.3.CSC` for controlled semantic coarsening, `A.6.4` for changed EntityOfConcern, and `E.17.EFP` for explanation-use adequacy.
- **Uses:** `C.33` when the narrative rendering is being used as architecture-relevant structural information and its captured and lost structure must be made explicit, the domain evaluation pattern when the same question is non-architecture narrative epiplexity, and `C.34` when selected source structure and narrative structure are treated as same enough for downstream use.
- **Coordinates with:** `A.22.CGUS` when the structure being rendered is itself a constraint-governed unfolding structure or when a `NarrativeUnfoldingStructureBlock` must keep selected source structure, ordering structure, reader-act sequence hypothesis, narrative rendering, preserved structure, and loss inspectable.
- **Coordinates with:** `C.35` for generated or discovered carriers that may contain candidate narrative renderings, `G.2` for source-pack claims, `E.6` and `E.11` for learning-order and first-entry publication questions, and `E.17` or `E.17.AUD` for publication-face and audience-unit questions.
- **Uses:** `G.11` when source-basis return currentness, freshness, telemetry, or source-pack decay is the live reason a NAR case must be refreshed before reuse.
- **Routes to:** `D.1` through `D.5`, `A.10`, and `B.3` when value frame, multilevel harm, conflict, decision use, bias, impact, evidence, or assurance becomes live.
- **Boundary:** NAR governs the exact episteme-to-episteme structure-to-sequence construction. It does not let a model, graph, set, stream, source pack, publication, form, carrier, or readable rendering substitute for `X` or `Y`; it does not publish `Y`, grant `U.View` membership, authorize reliance, prove source claims, admit generated output, decide ethics, create a teaching script, or make domain narrative vocabulary part of FPF Core.
